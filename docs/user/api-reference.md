# API Reference

This is a hand-written, conceptual reference for the Vela™ public surface — what each piece is for and how the pieces bind. A generated type reference (from the source declarations) may be added later; for now this prose is the source of truth.

## The mental model

Vela™ is a small **core** plus three independently swappable **layers** — data providers, scripting engines, and renderers — each reached through a single narrow **port**.

The **neutral model** — bars, series, pane overlays, drawings, inputs, update patches — is the only thing that crosses a port. No backend-specific type ever leaks across. That opacity is what makes each layer swappable. What ships is the native renderer and the provider-backed, cache-wrapped data feed — both plain **swappable defaults**. No scripting engine ships at all: you install one (Pine Script: `@luxalgo/vela-pinets`) or write one against the port — see [Scripting engines](./scripting-engines.md).

> These snippets import from the npm package `@luxalgo/vela` (see [installation.md](./installation.md)).

The higher-level shell is documented on its own page: [the workspace](./workspace.md) (`@luxalgo/vela/workspace` — one chart with `layout: false`, or a multi-chart grid with one shared chrome and sync links). It exposes the state surface — `getState()` / `applyState()` / `state:changed` over one shared document format — which is also what its `persist` option writes.

---

## `class Vela(container, options?, deps?)`

The public, imperative chart and the composition root — the one place that wires concrete backends.

- **`container`** — an `HTMLElement` or a CSS selector string. A missing selector throws.
- **`options`** — display, behavior, and market options. See [options.md](./options.md).
- **`deps`** — the **swap point** for the three layers (see below).

Constructing a chart renders candles immediately. Scripting engines are opt-in.

### Core methods

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `registerEngine(language, engine)` | Register a scripting engine under a language id so `addIndicator` can run that language. **Vela™ ships none** — install an addon or write one ([Scripting engines](./scripting-engines.md)). Re-registering a language replaces it (affects future indicators only). Returns the chart for chaining. |
| `addIndicator(source, options?)` | Run an indicator script over the chart's market data and render it. Returns an **`IndicatorHandle` synchronously**; values fill in asynchronously. See [options.md](./options.md) for per-indicator options. |
| `addNativeIndicator(type, options?)` | Add a core-computed (non-scripting) **native indicator** by registered `type`. Returns an `IndicatorHandle` (same lifecycle: legend row, eye/remove, events). The layer-backed types `'volume'` (auto-added) and `'vpvr'` (the visible-range volume profile) are **single-instance** — a second call returns the existing handle; the built-in classic studies (`'sma'`, `'rsi'`, …) allow **several instances**, so each call adds one more. Plugin chart types can register more (see `multiInstance` on the descriptor). `options.inputs` seeds inputs. Native renderer only; an unregistered type returns a fail-soft handle that never mounts. |
| `runScript(source, options?)` | Execute a script and resolve its **first computed run** — the data-out door for editors, consoles and dashboards. Resolves `{ ok: true, run }` with the [`ScriptRun`](#capturing-what-a-script-computes) itself, plus `onUpdate(cb)` to follow later runs and `remove()` to take it off the chart; `{ ok: false, error }` on a compile/runtime failure, which removes the script again (no dead legend row). Never rejects. Prefer it over `runIndicator` — same injection semantics, but it hands you the data instead of a handle to go fetch from. |
| `runIndicator(source, options?)` | Execute a script and **inject it only if the run succeeds** — the seam for host editors/consoles. Resolves `{ ok: true, handle }` after the first successful evaluation, or `{ ok: false, error, context }` on a compile/runtime failure — `context` is the post-mortem execution-context snapshot when the engine had produced one, and the failed indicator is removed again (no dead legend row). Never rejects. |
| `indicators()` | Live `IndicatorHandle[]` of everything on the chart (script + native), in insertion order — the seam for host panels (object trees, indicator lists) that need per-id visibility/removal. |
| `availableNativeIndicators()` | Returns `Promise<NativeIndicatorInfo[]>` — the catalog of built-in native indicators with their live state on this chart, for building an "add indicator" picker UI (lets a host list them, gate unsupported ones, avoid duplicates). Async because support may need to probe the provider (a type may need data the symbol lacks). |
| `presentNativeIndicators()` | Returns `string[]` — the native types present on the chart **right now**, one entry per instance (a multi-instance type repeats), synchronously (the presence slice of `availableNativeIndicators()`, which stays async only for support probing). Persistence snapshots read this: an unload-time save must see an add or remove made microseconds earlier. |
| `setMarket(next)` | Switch the chart's market **in place** — `{ symbol?, timeframe?, bars?, data?, visibleRange? }` — without destroying the chart. The symbol string carries the venue: bare = registered providers in declaration order, `'coinbase:BTC-USD'` pins one. Only the fields given change. Indicators re-execute over the new bars, native indicators restart, and panes, user drawings, renderer config and event subscriptions all **survive**. Resolves once the new market's history is painted (a deep backfill continues behind it — await `historyComplete()`); a call superseded by a newer `setMarket` resolves silently. Emits `market:changed` when the market identity changed (a depth-only `bars` reload is silent). `visibleRange` frames the first paint of the new market. Drawings are kept as-is — per-symbol drawing documents are a host policy (`chart.drawings.toJSON()/fromJSON()` keyed off `market:changed`). |
| `market` (getter) | The current market identity — the read counterpart of `setMarket`. A **snapshot** `{ symbol?, provider?, timeframe?, bars?, offline }` of the *requested* market (`provider` = the symbol's own `EXCHANGE:` prefix, or undefined when bare — the venue that actually served it is `chart.data.resolve(symbol)`): it reflects an in-flight switch immediately (before the new bars land), which is what persist-on-close flows want. Listen to `market:changed` for *committed* identity changes. Mutating the returned object changes nothing. |
| `ready()` | Returns a promise that resolves once the chart is painted and interactive. On a ranged feed the first paint is a small recent head (~200 bars) and the rest of the history keeps backfilling **behind** this — await `historyComplete()` for the full depth. |
| `historyComplete()` | Returns a promise that resolves once the **current load's** full requested history has loaded — immediately for small/offline charts, after the background backfill for deep ones. **Per-load**: each `setMarket` re-arms the cycle (the superseded load's promise resolves rather than hanging), so call it again after a switch for the new market's depth. Never rejects: on destroy or a failed backfill it resolves with whatever depth loaded. |
| `on(event, handler)` | Subscribe to a chart-level event. Returns an unsubscribe function. |
| `getVisibleRange()` | The current visible time range (`{ from, to }` in epoch-ms), or `null` before data loads. |
| `setVisibleRange(range)` | Set the visible time range explicitly (epoch-ms). Returns the chart for chaining. |
| `panBy(fraction)` | Pan by a fraction of the visible width — positive ⇒ toward the latest bars, negative ⇒ into history. Behaves exactly like dragging the chart: constant zoom, the same pan limits (forward stops at the newest candle plus the bounded empty space), eased on renderers that animate pans; repeated calls stack into one continuous scroll. The widget's `Ctrl/Cmd + ←/→` keys use it. Returns the chart for chaining. |
| `setVisibleRangePreset(preset)` | Frame a named date range over the loaded bars: `'1D'`, `'1W'`, `'1M'`, `'3M'`, `'6M'`, `'1Y'`, `'5Y'`, `'YTD'`, or `'ALL'`. A preset deeper than the loaded history just frames everything (it doesn't fetch more bars — the widget's range chips do that for you). Returns the chart for chaining. |
| `goToDate(when, opts?)` | Jump to a date/time (epoch-ms or `Date`) and frame `opts.bars` bars (default 120) centred on the nearest bar at-or-after it. Unlike `setVisibleRange`, a target older than the loaded history is **fetched first**: the history is deepened the way `replay.start` does it, sized from the density of the bars already loaded so session gaps don't over-fetch. A target older than the source's genesis frames the oldest bars. During a replay it frames only the revealed bars and never deepens. Resolves once the frame is applied. In the workspace, **Alt+G** and the bottom bar's calendar button open the *Go to* dialog — see [the bottom bar](./workspace.md#the-go-to-dialog). |
| `goToRange(from, to)` | Frame the bars between two instants (epoch-ms or `Date`; a reversed pair is swapped), from the first bar at-or-after the earlier one to the last bar at-or-before the later one. An end outside the data clamps to the oldest or newest bar; a range holding one bar or none still frames two. Like `goToDate`, a start older than the loaded history is **fetched first**, and during a replay only the revealed bars are framed. Resolves once the frame is applied. |
| `setTheme(theme)` | Swap the app theme at runtime — `'dark'`, `'light'`, or a full theme object (same shape as the `theme` option). Re-skins the chart surface, axes, legends and in-chart chrome live (no indicator re-run) and emits `theme:changed` with the resolved theme so surrounding host chrome can follow. Candle colors are shared across the built-in themes, so a swap never recolors the series. The same switch is available to users in chart settings → Canvas → Theme. Returns the chart for chaining. |
| `inspect()` | A renderer-agnostic snapshot of the graphic elements the core has generated (series, fills, drawings, tables, …) — a deterministic check that a feature was produced, independent of which renderer drew it. |
| `resize()` | Re-measure the container and relayout. Call after the container's size changes. |
| `destroy()` | Tear down the chart, renderer, engines, and subscriptions — no leaks. |

Because `registerEngine` returns the chart, you can wire an engine straight off construction:

```js
const chart = new Vela('#chart', { data: myBars, timeframe: '1h' })
  .registerEngine('pine', new PineEngine());
```

### Adding an indicator: sync handle, async data

`addIndicator` returns right away so you can wire up UI before any computation finishes. The script is prepared (its inputs are parsed) and then executed over the bar history; the plotted output appears when execution resolves. Listen on the handle's `ready` event (or `chart.ready()` for the whole chart) rather than assuming data is present on return. On a deep-history chart the indicator waits for the background backfill and then computes once over the full depth — its `ready` fires when that single run lands.

A minimal end-to-end setup — construct over data, register a scripting engine (here the Pine addon), add an indicator, then await the first render:

```js
import { Vela } from '@luxalgo/vela';
import { PineEngine } from '@luxalgo/vela-pinets';

const chart = new Vela('#chart', { data: myBars, timeframe: '1h', theme: 'dark' });
chart.registerEngine('pine', new PineEngine());

// addIndicator returns synchronously — wire UI now; plotted values fill in later.
const rsi = chart.addIndicator(`//@version=5
indicator("RSI")
plot(ta.rsi(close, input.int(14, "Length")), "RSI", color.purple)`);
rsi.on('ready', () => console.log(rsi.title, 'has computed'));

await chart.ready(); // resolves once the chart is painted and interactive
```

---

## `IndicatorHandle`

What `addIndicator` returns. Usable immediately.

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | This instance's identity on the chart — the `id` you passed in the options, else one the chart minted. Stable for as long as the indicator stays on it (input edits, hide/show and `updateCode` all keep it). See the `id` option in [options.md](./options.md#per-indicator-options). |
| `title` | Display title (overridable via the `title` option). |
| `source` | The script source the indicator currently runs — the one it was added with, until `updateCode` replaces it; `undefined` for a native indicator. |
| `nativeType` | The registered type of a native indicator (`'volume'`, `'sma'`, …); `undefined` for a script indicator. A handle has one of `source` or `nativeType`, never both. |
| `inputs` | The inputs parsed from the script source — each with a `key`, `title`, `type`, `defval`, and optional `min`/`max`/`step`/`options`/`group`/`inline`/`tab`/`tooltip`. Populated once the script is prepared. |
| `props` | The script's declaration properties (a strategy's `initial_capital`, an indicator's `precision`, …) in the same schema shape as `inputs`. Empty when the engine exposes none. |
| `visible` | Whether the indicator is currently shown. |
| `setInput(key, value)` | Change one input by its key. Triggers a re-run (an input edit can restructure output, so this may remount the indicator). |
| `setInputs(values)` | Change several inputs at once, keyed by input key or title. |
| `setProp(key, value)` | Override one declaration property (e.g. `initial_capital`). A prop change replays the whole script. |
| `setProps(values)` | Override several declaration properties at once. |
| `updateCode(source)` | Replace the script and re-run it **in place** — same `id`, legend row, pane placement and handle. The new source is compiled first; only then is the running script stopped and the new one started, so a broken edit leaves the current indicator computing and painting and reports through `error`. Input and prop values survive where the new script still declares their key; anything else takes the new default. No-op for a native indicator and for an unchanged source. |
| `setVisible(visible)` | Hide or show the indicator. Hiding suspends it — its visuals are dropped and its computation stops; showing re-runs it over the current bars. |
| `on(event, handler)` | Per-indicator events — `ready`, `error` (`{ error }`), `alert` (`{ id, message, title?, time }`). Returns an unsubscribe function. |
| `context(select?)` | `Promise` of a **read-only, serializable snapshot** of the engine's execution context — see [below](#capturing-what-a-script-computes). `null` when the engine lacks the capability or nothing ran yet. |
| `remove()` | Remove this indicator from the chart. |

The handle is usable the moment `addIndicator` returns; drive the indicator's lifecycle through its events and mutators:

```js
const macd = chart.addIndicator(macdSource);

// React to the computation outcome.
macd.on('ready', () => console.log('inputs:', macd.inputs.map((i) => i.key)));
macd.on('error', ({ error }) => console.error('MACD failed:', error.message));

// Retune inputs — each change triggers a re-run.
macd.setInput('fast', 8);
macd.setInputs({ slow: 21, signal: 5 });

// Swap the code under the same row — an editor's "run my edit". A source that fails
// to compile leaves the current MACD running and fires `error` instead.
macd.updateCode(editedMacdSource);

// Hiding suspends it (visuals dropped, computation stopped); showing re-runs it.
macd.setVisible(false);
console.log(macd.visible); // false

macd.remove(); // drop it from the chart
```

### Capturing what a script computes

Two doors, one vocabulary. `script:run` reports **every** script the chart runs; `runScript()`
executes one and hands you its first run. Both deliver the same `ScriptRun` object, so host
code reads a manifest indicator, a console `addIndicator`, and an editor's script identically.

```js
chart.on('script:run', (run) => {
    run.title;          // 'SMA cross' — the title the script DECLARED
    run.kind;           // 'indicator' | 'strategy'
    run.cause;          // why it computed (see below)
    run.bar;            // index of the last computed bar
    run.plots.fast;     // that plot's value at that bar
    run.vars.fastLen;   // the script's own variables, by their SOURCE names

    if (run.strategy) {
        run.strategy.position; // signed contracts held
        run.strategy.equity;
        run.strategy.openPnl;
        run.strategy.netPnl;
    }
});
```

The handle is already resolved and the data already extracted — there is nothing to look up
and nothing to await.

#### Provisional vs final

`cause` is the field that decides whether a value can be trusted:

| `cause` | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `'history'` | The first computation over the loaded history. |
| `'tick'` | The forming bar changed — **values can still move**. |
| `'bar'` | A new bar opened, so the one before it is **final**. |
| `'inputs'` | An input was edited. |
| `'code'` | The script was replaced in place (`handle.updateCode`). |
| `'viewport'` | The visible range moved (viewport-aware scripts only). |
| `'market'` | The chart's market changed and the script re-executed. |

Anything that records, alerts, or exports should key off `'bar'`:

```js
chart.on('script:run', (run) => {
    if (run.cause === 'bar') persist(run);  // a bar just closed — settled
    else updateDashboard(run);              // provisional
});
```

`'tick'` runs are **throttled to ~1/s** per indicator (a live stream re-executes the open
candle several times a second, which no dashboard can use). Every other cause is emitted
unconditionally — dropping a `'bar'` run would break exactly the case above.

Two more flags round out the picture: `forming` is true while the run's last bar is still
open (always so on a live chart, never on a static one), and `complete` is false only while
an engine that computes progressively is still being fed a deep backfill.

#### What rides the run, and what you ask for

Flat and at the current bar → on the run. Historical and unbounded → an explicit call, so a
per-tick listener never ships a ledger it will not read:

```js
const trades = await run.trades();      // the strategy's round trips, closed then open
const history = await run.series('fast'); // one plot's full history
```

#### Executing a script and capturing its result

```js
const result = await chart.runScript(source);
if (!result.ok) return console.error(result.error);

result.run.strategy.netPnl;
const off = result.onUpdate((run) => console.log(run.strategy.openPnl));
result.remove();                        // take it off the chart
```

`runScript` resolves on the **first computed run**, injects the script only if it runs (a
failure removes it again — no dead legend row), and never rejects.

#### Across a grid

`@luxalgo/vela/workspace` relays the same event with the cell it came from, so one subscription covers
every cell — including cells a later layout change creates:

```js
ws.on('script:run', (run) => console.log(run.cell, run.title, run.strategy?.equity));
```

#### The lower-level snapshot

`handle.context(select?)` remains the pull counterpart — a **read-only** deep copy of the
engine's execution context (`phase`, `barIndex`, `meta`, `plots`, `variables`, `strategy`,
`trades`, `warnings`), async on both the in-process and Web-Worker engines (the context never
leaves the worker; only the snapshot crosses), and selective via `select`. `script:run` is
built on it and is what host code should normally use; reach for `context()` when you want a
snapshot at a moment of *your* choosing rather than at a run. On a `runIndicator` failure the
same snapshot is attached post-mortem (`{ ok: false, error, context }`) — the state at the
moment of the crash.

## Chart-level events

Subscribe with `chart.on(event, handler)`; every subscription returns an unsubscribe function.

| Event | Payload | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `ready` | — | The chart is painted and interactive (a deep chart's history may still be backfilling). |
| `market:changed` | `{ symbol, timeframe, prev: { symbol, timeframe } }` | The market switched **in place** via `setMarket` — symbol (venue prefix included), timeframe, or offline data changed (a depth-only reload does not fire). Fires after the new market's history is painted and every consumer restarted. `prev` lets hosts re-key per-symbol state (e.g. swap user-drawing documents between symbols). |
| `load:start` | `{ symbol, timeframe, firstLoad }` | A bar load began with nothing painted: the first load (fires during construction — later subscribers see only its `load:end`), or an identity switch, which blanks the old series in the same breath. Fires **before** the first fetch — plugins and custom indicators hide or reset their own visuals here. A depth-only reload fires neither event. |
| `load:end` | `{ symbol, timeframe, bars }` | The load ended: its first bars painted (`bars` > 0 — on deep histories the quick preview), or it ended with none (`bars` = 0 — a failed fetch, an empty market, or a parked symbol). Exactly one per `load:start`; plugins restore or rebuild their visuals here. |
| `history:progress` | `{ loaded, target }` | A deep-history backfill chunk landed — `loaded` of `target` bars are on the chart. |
| `history:complete` | `{ reason, oldestTime, barsLoaded }` | The history load finished. `reason`: `'depth'` (requested count loaded), `'genesis'` (the source has nothing older), or `'aborted'` (a fetch failed — the chart keeps what loaded). Fires exactly once, including for small/offline charts. |
| `indicator:added` | `{ id }` | An indicator was added. |
| `indicator:removed` | `{ id }` | An indicator was removed. |
| `indicator:error` | `{ id, error }` | An indicator failed. |
| `script:run` | the [`ScriptRun`](#capturing-what-a-script-computes) | A script computed — the first pass over the history, a live tick, a new bar, an input edit, a viewport move, a market switch. Carries the run itself (title, cause, the plots/variables/broker state at the computed bar), so a listener reads it instead of resolving a handle and pulling a snapshot. Forming-bar (`'tick'`) runs are throttled to ~1/s; every other cause fires unconditionally. Never fires for native indicators — they run no script. |
| `context:changed` | `{ id }` | An indicator's execution context advanced (run finished; throttled to ~1/s while streaming). Re-pull `handle.context()` if you consume it. Fires only for context-capable engines. **Prefer `script:run`**, which delivers the data rather than a signal to go fetch it. |
| `bar` | the bar (OHLCV) | A live tick — the forming bar updated or a new bar appended. A bar revealed by a [replay](#chartreplay--the-bar-replay-control-surface) fires it too. |
| `replay:start` | `{ cursorTime, remaining }` | Replay began (or seeked): the chart shows history up to `cursorTime`, `remaining` bars are hidden. |
| `replay:step` | `{ cursorTime, remaining }` | Replay revealed one bar (a bar played tick by tick steps when it settles). |
| `replay:tick` | `{ cursorTime, index, count }` | [Tick replay](#tick-replay) applied tick `index` of `count` to the bar forming at `cursorTime`. |
| `replay:play` · `replay:pause` | `{ intervalMs }` · — | Timed reveal started (or changed pace) · paused (`pause()`, or a seek while playing). |
| `replay:end` | `{ reason }` | Replay ended and the full history is back: `'stopped'` (`stop()`), `'finished'` (the last bar was revealed), or `'market'` (a symbol switch replaced the history — a timeframe or session switch keeps the replay). |
| `viewport:changed` | `{ from, to }` (epoch-ms) | The visible time range moved (pan/zoom/fit) — fires per applied change, not debounced. The seam viewport-sync links between charts build on. |
| `theme:changed` | the resolved theme object | The app theme changed — `setTheme(...)` or the in-chart settings dialog (Canvas → Theme). Host chrome around the chart (toolbars, panels, page shells) re-skins from the payload. Plot-only cosmetic edits (a `layout.background` set through the config) do **not** fire it. |
| `mark:click` | `{ id, ids, time, group? }` | A [timeline mark](#chartmarks--the-timeline-marks-control-surface) glyph was clicked — `ids` lists every mark under it (several marks of one group on one bar fold into a cluster), `id`/`time` its first. Fires before the popup opens; a mark without content opens none, so this is where a host shows its own UI. |
| `alert` | engine alert | A script raised an alert. Never fires for bars a [replay](#chartreplay--the-bar-replay-control-surface) reveals. |
| `warning` | engine warning | A script raised a warning. |

---

## `chart.renderer` — the renderer control surface

A thin facade over the active renderer for reading and changing **how the chart is drawn**
at runtime, with **no indicator re-run**. Unsupported keys/methods warn and no-op, so the
chart is never left half-changed.

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | The active renderer's identity, e.g. `'native'`. |
| `capabilities` | What the renderer can draw (drives graceful degradation). |
| `supports(feature)` | Whether a feature is available — use to show/hide a UI control. |
| `get(feature)` | Read a feature's current value (`undefined` if unsupported). |
| `set(feature, value)` / `set({ … })` | Apply one feature, or several at once (one repaint). |
| `screenshot()` | Export the chart as a PNG data URL, or `null` if unsupported. Composites the geometry and chrome layers only — the crosshair, DOM overlays (tables, legend), user drawings, and the volume-profile layer are not included. |
| `getConfig()` | Snapshot the renderer's full cosmetics as a serializable, versioned JSON document (or `null`). |
| `applyConfig(config)` | Apply a full or partial config document from `getConfig()`; malformed/unknown fields are ignored. |
| `onConfigChanged(cb)` | Subscribe to cosmetic-config changes — the in-chart settings dialog commits through `applyConfig`, so this is how host chrome mirroring a config value (a time-zone display, a saved template) learns about in-chart edits. Re-pull `get(…)`/`getConfig()` in the callback. Returns an unsubscribe fn; silent no-op unsubscribe on a renderer without a rich config. |
| `onCrosshairMove(cb)` | Subscribe to crosshair movement — `time`/`price` under the cursor, per-series values, and the hovered bar's OHLC (null fields when the cursor leaves the chart). Returns an unsubscribe fn. The public seam for host status lines and data windows. |
| `onClick(cb)` | Subscribe to clicks — and touch taps — on the plot (never the end of a pan): `{ time }` is the open time of the bar under it (`null` off the bars). On touch a tap moves no crosshair, so this is how an interaction learns which bar was chosen. Returns an unsubscribe fn. |
| `dataWindowReadout()` | The bar under the crosshair (or the latest bar when the cursor is off the plot) as a display-ready snapshot: `date`, `time`, an `ohlc` block, and one `groups` entry per indicator with a row per plot in its own color. Values are pre-formatted on their pane's scale. `null` on a renderer without the seam — see [renderer features](./renderer-features.md#data-window-readout). |
| `setExternalCrosshair(time, price?)` | Show (or clear, with `null`) a **ghost crosshair** at a data-space position driven from OUTSIDE this chart — the multi-chart crosshair-sync seam ([the workspace](./workspace.md) drives it from the linked cells' pointers). A ghost never re-emits `onCrosshairMove` (one-way by contract — no echo loops). A [`crosshairOverride`](./renderer-features.md) applies to the ghost too — its line style and its `shadeRight` veil, which covers every bar in view when the ghost lies left of the window. Silent no-op on a renderer without the optional port seam; feature-detect with `supportsExternalCrosshair`. |
| `set('dialogHost', el)` | Where the renderer mounts its MODAL dialogs (chart settings, indicator settings). Multi-chart shells pass their root element so dialogs center over the whole grid instead of clipping inside one cell — the workspace does this automatically for every cell. Runtime-only; never part of the config template. |
| `supportsExternalCrosshair` (getter) | Whether the active renderer implements the optional `setExternalCrosshair` seam (the native renderer does). |
| `setWallClock(clock)` | Drive the renderer's time-of-day chrome (the price-axis countdown to bar close) from the host's own second pulse — a `WallClock` (`SecondClock` is the exported second-aligned implementation) — so it ticks in step with a host clock display instead of on a separate timer that can read a different second. `null` hands the pulse back to the renderer. [The workspace](./workspace.md) does this for every cell with its bottom-bar clock. Silent no-op on a renderer without time-of-day chrome. |
| `focus()` | Move keyboard focus back onto the chart's interactive surface — call after a host control (e.g. a shared toolbar button) stole focus, so chart/drawing shortcuts keep working. Silent no-op on a renderer without a focusable surface. |

Feature-detect, read, and change how the chart is drawn at runtime — with no indicator re-run:

```js
// Only touch a feature the active renderer actually supports.
if (chart.renderer.supports('glow')) {
    console.log('glow is', chart.renderer.get('glow'));
    chart.renderer.set('glow', 0.6);
}

// Apply several features at once (one repaint).
chart.renderer.set({ logScale: true, currentPriceLine: false });
```

See [renderer-features.md](./renderer-features.md) for the full feature catalog (common +
native-specific) and config/screenshot examples.

## `chart.data` — the data control surface

A facade over the provider registry for **where candles come from**. Register one or more
market-data providers; the chart routes each symbol to the right one. No provider is bundled —
registering the one that resolves the chart symbol fires the parked initial load.

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `registerProvider(name, provider)` | Register (or replace) a provider; chainable. Fires the parked load when it resolves the symbol. |
| `unregisterProvider(name)` | Remove a provider. |
| `providers()` | Metadata for every registered provider. |
| `resolve(symbol)` | How a symbol routes now (`{ provider, ticker }`, or `null`). Accepts a provider-name prefix or a descriptor-declared **listing prefix** (`NASDAQ:AAPL` — strict: a wrong venue resolves to `null`). |
| `displayPrefix(symbol)` | The venue label to display — the descriptor's listing prefix when declared, else the resolved provider name. `null` while unresolvable. |
| `canonicalSymbol(symbol)` | The canonical `PREFIX:TICKER` form of the symbol (`edgx:aapl` → `NASDAQ:AAPL`). `null` while unresolvable. |
| `symbols(provider?)` | Indexed symbols for autocomplete — one provider, or all. |
| `symbolInfo(symbol)` | `Promise` of per-symbol metadata (Pine `syminfo.*`), via the owning provider. |
| `capabilities(symbol)` | The full resolved per-symbol `ProviderCapabilities` (behavior flags), or `null` while nothing resolves the symbol. |
| `ready()` | Resolves when every provider's symbol index has settled. |

Register the provider that resolves the chart symbol, then wait for both the index and the initial load:

```js
import { Vela } from '@luxalgo/vela';
import { BinanceProvider } from '@luxalgo/vela/providers/binance';

const chart = new Vela('#chart', { symbol: 'BTCUSDT', timeframe: '1h' });

// Registering the provider that resolves the symbol fires the parked initial load.
chart.data.registerProvider('binance', new BinanceProvider());
await chart.data.ready(); // provider symbol indexes settled
await chart.ready();      // chart painted and interactive

console.log(chart.data.resolve('BTCUSDT'));            // { provider: 'binance', ticker: 'BTCUSDT' }
console.log(chart.data.symbols('binance').length, 'symbols indexed');
console.log(chart.data.capabilities('BTCUSDT'));       // ProviderCapabilities | null
```

On a chart given a custom `deps.dataFeed`, these warn and no-op (that feed owns its data). See
[data-providers.md](./data-providers.md) for symbol formats, resolution, and the load lifecycle.

## `chart.drawings` — the drawings control surface

A chainable facade over the interactive [drawing tools](./drawing-tools.md). The drawing **model is
core-owned**, so the *interactive* methods are capability-gated (they warn + no-op when the renderer
can't paint drawings — `chart.drawings.supported` reports this), while the **model methods**
(reading, persisting, undo) always work.

| Member | Gated? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `supported` | — | Whether the renderer can paint interactive drawings. |
| `setTool(type \| null)` | yes | Arm a tool for the next clicks; `null` returns to select/idle. |
| `getTool()` | no | The armed tool (`null` = select/idle). Follow changes on `drawing:tool`. |
| `setSnapMode(mode)` · `getSnapMode()` | yes / no | The magnet: `'off' \| 'weak' \| 'strong'`. Changes land on `drawing:snap`. |
| `setStayMode(on)` · `getStayMode()` | yes / no | Stay in drawing mode: keep the tool armed after each placement. Changes land on `drawing:stay`. |
| `setMode(mode)` · `getMode()` | yes / no | Renderer-local mode: `'measure' \| 'eraser' \| null`. Mutually exclusive with armed tools (the renderer enforces it); changes land on `drawing:mode`. |
| `showToolbar(visible?)` | yes | Show/hide the on-chart toolbar. |
| `setToolbar(option)` | yes | Reconfigure the toolbar groups/tools live. |
| `setToolShortcuts(map)` | yes | Show per-tool shortcut hints in the toolbar flyouts — `{ trendline: 'Alt+T', … }`. Values are pre-formatted display strings: the host owns the keymap and the platform formatting. The widget/workspace push their own bindings automatically. |
| `add(type, init?)` | yes | Create a drawing from code; returns the `Drawing` (or `null` if unsupported). |
| `remove(id)` | no | Delete a drawing. |
| `update(id, patch)` | no | Apply a partial serialized record (for a custom settings UI). |
| `lock(id, v?)` · `show(id, v?)` | no | Lock/unlock · show/hide a single drawing. |
| `bringToFront(id)` · `sendToBack(id)` | no | Reorder paint order. With the `drawingDepth` capability they clear the whole stack — candles and indicators included, not just the other drawings. |
| `zIndex` (on `add`'s init and `update`'s patch) | no | The draw-order key. On a `drawingDepth` renderer it shares one space with the pane's series, so a drawing can sit under the candles or between two indicators — see [depth](./drawing-tools.md#depth-anywhere-in-the-stack). Persists with the drawing either way. |
| `undo()` · `redo()` · `canUndo()` · `canRedo()` | no | Snapshot history (core-owned). |
| `clone(id)` · `duplicate(ids)` | yes | Copy in place; the copies become the selection. |
| `copyToClipboard(ids)` · `paste()` | yes | In-memory, per-chart clipboard. |
| `all()` | no | Every drawing as plain JSON, in paint order. |
| `toJSON()` / `fromJSON(doc)` | no | Snapshot / restore a versioned `DrawingsDocument` (untrusted-safe). |
| `getConfig()` / `applyConfig(doc)` | no | Aliases of `toJSON` / `fromJSON`, mirroring `chart.renderer`. |

Drawing lifecycle is also surfaced as chart events (`drawing:created` / `drawing:edited` /
`drawing:removed` / `drawing:selected` / `drawing:settings` — `drawing:selected` carries the
primary `id` plus `ids`, every member of a multi-selection), and the tool/mode state as
`drawing:tool` / `drawing:snap` / `drawing:stay` / `drawing:mode` — the seam an external toolbar mirrors. See
[Drawing tools](./drawing-tools.md) for the tool catalogue, toolbar UX, and keyboard shortcuts.

## `chart.marks` — the timeline-marks control surface

Host events pinned to a moment in time — dividends, splits, earnings, releases — shown as small
colored **glyphs on a lane just above the time axis**, each opening a **popup** on click. The model
is core-owned, so every method works on any renderer; on one without the `timelineMarks`
capability nothing paints (`supported` reports it). Marks are **data, not user state**: the chart
never persists them — re-supply them on `market:changed`. What *is* saved with the chart's config
is each group's visibility (the checkboxes on the chart settings' **Events** tab, which
appears once marks name groups). The [Timeline marks](./timeline-marks.md) guide walks through
the whole surface with examples.

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `supported` | Whether the active renderer paints timeline marks. |
| `add(mark)` | Add one mark; an existing id is replaced in place. Chainable. |
| `set(marks)` | Replace the whole set (a market switch). |
| `remove(id)` · `clear()` | Drop one mark, or all of them. |
| `all()` | Every mark, in insertion order. |
| `defineGroup({ id, label, visible? })` | Name a visibility group: the label of its checkbox in settings and its default visibility. A mark may name a group that was never defined — it then shows its capitalized id. |
| `groups()` | The defined groups, in definition order. |
| `setGroupVisible(id, visible?)` · `isGroupVisible(id)` | The same switch as the settings checkbox; the choice is persisted with the chart's config. On a renderer without the `marks` feature the setter warns and no-ops. |

A mark is `{ id, time, glyph, title?, tooltip?, group?, content? }`:

- **`time`** is epoch-ms, but the glyph never sits at that exact pixel: it centers on **the bar whose
  span contains the time**. A time in a gap (a weekend, a closed session) goes to the first bar that
  follows; one past the newest bar projects onto the extrapolated grid in the right whitespace. Change
  timeframe and the marks re-snap.
- **`glyph`** is a colored token — `{ shape?, color, letter? }` (`'circle'` · `'square'` · `'diamond'` ·
  `'pin'`, one or two characters in auto-contrasted ink) or `{ shape?, color, icon }` with an id from the
  icon registry (`registerIcon` from `vela/ui`). Icons travel as ids, never inline markup, so a mark
  payload can come from data.
- **`content`** is what the popup shows under `title`: `{ text }` (escaped), `{ html }` (sanitized
  through an allowlist — scripts, styles, frames, event handlers and `javascript:` URLs never reach the
  page; links open in a new tab), or `{ panel: { items } }` — rows of `text`, `field` (label/value)
  and `button` (`run`, optional `primary`, `close`). Pass a **function** (sync or async) instead and
  it resolves when the popup needs it — details fetched on click, one entry at a time as the user
  scrolls. Without `content` a click only emits `mark:click`.
- **`group`** folds marks of one kind that land on the same bar into **one slightly larger glyph**
  listing them all (earliest first); marks of *different* groups on one bar **stack** — a small deck
  that fans out on hover (or a tap on touch) so each can be opened.

```js
import { registerIcon, svg16 } from '@luxalgo/vela/ui';

registerIcon('myco.split', svg16('<path d="M8 2v12M3 5l5-3 5 3M3 11l5 3 5-3"/>'));

chart.marks
    .defineGroup({ id: 'dividends', label: 'Dividends' })
    .defineGroup({ id: 'splits', label: 'Splits' })
    .add({
        id: 'div-2024-06-11',
        time: Date.UTC(2024, 5, 11),
        title: 'Dividends',
        group: 'dividends',
        glyph: { shape: 'circle', color: '#2962ff', letter: 'D' },
        tooltip: 'Dividend · $0.01',
        content: {
            panel: {
                items: [
                    { type: 'field', label: 'Ex-dividend date', value: "Tue 11 Jun '24" },
                    { type: 'field', label: 'Amount', value: '0.01' },
                    { type: 'button', label: 'More NVDA dividends', primary: true, run: () => openDividends('NVDA') },
                ],
            },
        },
    })
    .add({
        id: 'split-2024-06-10',
        time: Date.UTC(2024, 5, 10),
        title: 'Stock split',
        group: 'splits',
        glyph: { icon: 'myco.split', color: '#ff9800' },
        content: async () => ({ html: await fetchSplitDetails('NVDA') }),
    });

chart.on('mark:click', ({ id, ids, time }) => { /* ids = every mark under the clicked glyph */ });
chart.on('market:changed', ({ symbol }) => chart.marks.set(marksFor(symbol)));
chart.renderer.set('marks', false); // hide the whole lane (`{ groups: { splits: false } }` hides one group)
```

## `chart.replay` — the bar-replay control surface

Rewind the chart to a past bar and reveal the bars that followed, one at a time, by hand or on a
timer. The replay walks the history **already loaded** — nothing is refetched per bar. Each revealed
bar travels the same path as a live bar: indicators update as if it had just closed (a script sees
it as a real-time bar), chart-type data engines are told through `onBars`, and the `bar` event
fires. While replaying, live updates are paused; stopping (or revealing the last bar) restores the
full history, resumes them, and fetches the bars that closed in the meantime. Switching the
timeframe (or session) keeps the replay going on the new bars, at the same point in time: the
chart keeps the bars that had closed by the end of what was revealed (a coarser bar still open at
that point stays hidden), and playback carries on if it was on. Switching the symbol ends the replay.
Script alerts stay quiet while a replay runs: a replayed bar is history, so it never raises the
`alert` event (on the chart or on an indicator handle). In a multi-chart workspace,
[`workspace.replay`](./workspace.md#bar-replay-across-the-grid) replays every chart together on
one clock.

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `start({ from })` | Enter replay at epoch-ms `from`: the chart keeps every bar that opened at or before it and hides the rest. Resolves once the rewound history is on screen — at once when `from` falls inside the loaded bars, even while older history is still streaming in (it joins the replay as it lands). An older `from` than the loaded history deepens it first (`from: 0` loads everything the source has), and the chart returns to its previous depth when the replay ends; a `from` with no bar after it warns and does nothing. Called while replaying, it **seeks** — backward or forward — and pauses. Every indicator re-runs over the rewound history. |
| `step()` | Reveal the next bar — or, mid-way through a bar played tick by tick, complete it. Returns `false` when replay is off. |
| `stepUpdate()` | Reveal the next update: with [tick replay](#tick-replay), the forming bar's next tick, or the next bar opened at its first tick (once its ticks are in); otherwise the next whole bar. Returns `false` when nothing is left. |
| `play(intervalMs?)` | Reveal one bar every `intervalMs` — one update, with [tick replay](#tick-replay) (default: the last pace, initially 1000). Calling it again while playing changes the pace. |
| `pause()` | Stop the timer; the replay stays where it is. |
| `stop()` | Leave replay: full history back, live updates resumed. Called while a `start()` is still loading older history, it cancels that load instead (the chart returns to its previous depth, the pending `start()` resolves without replaying). |
| `state` | `{ active, playing, cursorTime, remaining, nextTime, intervalMs }` — `cursorTime` is the newest bar on screen (`null` when off, and while a timeframe switch reloads the bars — `active` stays `true` through it); `nextTime` is the open time of the next bar a step completes (`null` when nothing is left). |
| `bounds` | `{ first, last }` — the open times of the oldest and newest bar a replay can start from (hidden bars included while replaying), or `null` before any bar loaded. A random start, or a "start from the first bar" button, reads it. |
| `setTicks(source \| null)` | Play each revealed bar as intrabar updates instead of whole (see below); `null` goes back to whole bars. |

```js
await chart.replay.start({ from: Date.UTC(2024, 5, 3, 14) });
chart.replay.play(2000);                 // one bar every 2 s
chart.on('replay:step', ({ cursorTime, remaining }) => updateUi(cursorTime, remaining));
chart.on('replay:end', ({ reason }) => hideUi(reason));
```

### Tick replay

`setTicks(source)` makes a playing replay build each bar the way a live one forms: `source(bar,
{ end, signal })` returns the bar's intrabar updates, oldest first — `{ price, high?, low?, open?,
volume? }[]`, or a promise of it — covering `[bar.time, end)`. The forming candle opens at the
first update (`open`, else its price), every update moves its close to `price` and stretches its
high and low to include `high`/`low`, and the last one settles it on the stored bar, so indicators
end exactly where a whole-bar replay leaves them. Each update travels the live-tick path
(indicators, chart types and the `bar` event follow) and fires `replay:tick`; the bar still fires
`replay:step` once, when it settles.

- The play interval becomes the time between two **updates**: a bar lasts as many intervals as it
  has ticks (a 15m bar from 1m updates takes 15 intervals). Below ~16 ms, updates are batched.
- Volume adds up from the ticks' own; when none carries one, the bar's volume is spread evenly.
- The next bar's ticks are requested while the current one plays; playback waits for them if they
  are late. An empty answer, or a failure, reveals that bar whole.
- A seek, a stop or a new source aborts the requests in flight (`signal`) and puts a half-formed
  bar back in its stored form.

The source decides where the prices come from — trades, a synthetic path, or finer bars.
`lowerTimeframeTicks(chart, timeframe)` covers the last case from the chart's own provider: it
fetches the `timeframe` bars inside each replayed bar and makes each one update — its close, its
high and low, its volume (`barsToTicks` does that step on bars you already have).

```js
import { lowerTimeframeTicks } from '@luxalgo/vela';

chart.replay.setTicks(lowerTimeframeTicks(chart, '1'));   // replay 1h bars through their 1m bars
chart.replay.play(1000);                                  // one 1m update per second: 60 s per bar
chart.on('replay:tick', ({ index, count }) => showProgress(index / count));
```

The price-axis countdown to bar close reads the real clock, so it stays hidden while replaying —
every bar on screen closed long ago.

## `deps` — the swap point

The optional third constructor argument is where you replace a layer's default with your own implementation of that layer's port:

| Key | Replaces | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| `renderer` | The drawing/output layer. Injects an already-constructed renderer *instance*, bypassing the `renderer` option's display-options wiring (a different axis from built-in vs custom — `options.renderer` already accepts any custom class too). | [Adding a renderer](../contributing/adding-a-renderer.md) |
| `engines` | Scripting engines to register at construction (bulk form of `registerEngine`). | [Scripting engines](./scripting-engines.md) · [Adding an engine](../contributing/adding-an-engine.md) |
| `dataFeed` | The market-data source. Replaces the default provider registry entirely with your own `MarketDataFeed` (used bare — no registry, no auto-cache). | [Adding a data provider](../contributing/adding-a-data-provider.md) |

Each layer is one narrow port — implement it, declare its honest capabilities, and inject it here. The composition root is the only place that imports concrete backends.

> The three *adding-a-backend* guides are **Contributing** docs and are still being written. Until they land, no link points at them — see the Contributing section of the [docs index](../index.md).

> **Stability:** The API is still stabilizing and will evolve as the library develops; pin a source revision if you need a fixed surface.
