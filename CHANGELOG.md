# Changelog

All notable changes to Vela, newest first.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A layout picker that splits the chart area the TradingView way.** The topbar's layout button
  now wears a diagram of the current arrangement, and its dropdown lists the layouts by window
  count (1, 2, 3 … 9, 12, 16), a diagram for each: side by side, stacked, grids, rows of five or
  six, and one big window with the rest small (left, right, top or bottom). The current one is
  marked, a click applies it, and the *Sync in layout* switches (Symbol, Interval, Crosshair, Time,
  Drawings, Style) sit below. A window added by the switch opens on the active window's symbol and
  timeframe. `layoutCatalog()` and `layoutRects()` are exported; the phone drawer keeps its tap grid.
- **Replay bar polish.** The topbar's Replay button is labelled and lights up in the selection
  colours while a start is being chosen or a replay runs. A dashed vertical line keeps the bar
  the replay started on marked on every chart (`replayStart` renderer feature). The floating
  bar gets a grip to drag it anywhere in the grid and a pin that locks it there and remembers
  the spot across replays and reloads.
- **Symbol name and pre/post-market price on the last-price label.** The last price now carries
  the symbol's name in a block against the axis, and a chart showing only the regular session
  draws the latest pre-market ("Pre", orange) or after-hours ("Post", blue) price as its own
  chip with a dotted line — stepping aside when it lands next to the regular label, and gone
  once the next session's first bar arrives. A provider supplies it through the optional
  `getExtendedQuote(ticker)`. Three new switches in Scales and lines: *Symbol name label*,
  *Pre/post market price label* and *Pre/post market price line*.
- **Saved layouts.** The new `layouts` option takes a `LayoutStore` (where layouts live) and
  adds a topbar button with the current layout's name and a *Manage layouts* menu: Save layout,
  an Autosave switch, Make a copy…, Rename…, Download chart data… (CSV of the loaded bars),
  Create new layout…, the four most recently used layouts, and Open layout… for a searchable,
  sortable *Layouts* dialog with delete. A layout is the whole workspace state — symbols,
  timeframes, indicators, drawings, panels — and the last one used opens on start. New
  `chart.getBars()` returns the loaded bars; `'layouts'` joins the `topbar` entries (default:
  first on the right).
- **Replay controls in the workspace.** A Replay button in the topbar
  starts a replay without any code: a dashed line follows the pointer to the bar under it
  with everything to its right veiled — mirrored on the other charts of a multi-chart layout —
  and a click on a bar starts the replay there, paused. You can also type a date instead.
  A floating bar then plays and pauses, steps one bar, switches between 1x, 3x and 10x, shows
  how many bars are left, lets you choose another start, and exits back to the full history on
  every chart. Start it from any chart: the others show the bars that had closed by then. The
  `topbar` option's new `'replay'` entry removes the button.
- **A full Go to dialog, with a button in the bottom bar.** A calendar button after the range
  chips (and Alt+G) opens *Go to*: a Date tab with a day field, a time field and a month
  calendar, and a Custom range tab where two clicks on the calendar choose a start and an end.
  Days after today are not pickable, the week starts on Monday, and everything is read in the
  chart's time zone. The new `chart.goToRange(from, to)` frames the bars between two instants,
  loading older history first when needed. The replay's *Select date…* uses the same dialog
  for a single date.

### Fixed

- **The Go to dialog resolves typed words against its own clock.** `yesterday` and `06-15` were read
  against the real clock while "today" came from the dialog's, so they could be refused (or accepted)
  across a day boundary.
- **Indicator titles stay readable in a squeezed pane.** The wash behind an indicator's title and
  values is nearly solid in an indicator pane (it was 60% everywhere), so reference lines no
  longer strike through the text when the pane is short; the price pane keeps the light wash so
  candles show through.
- **A chart zoomed in to a few bars no longer goes blank when its bars are replaced.** After a
  symbol or timeframe switch, or a replay starting further back, a chart showing fewer bars
  than its right margin held its newest candles outside the view and drew nothing. It now
  keeps the newest candles on screen.

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- **Bar replay.** `chart.replay` rewinds the chart to any past bar and plays the following
  bars back one at a time — by hand with `step()`, or on a timer with `play(intervalMs)` at
  the pace you choose. Indicators update as each bar appears, exactly as they would live,
  while their alerts stay quiet — a replayed bar is history, not a signal to act on —
  and live updates wait until you `stop()` or the replay reaches the present; the chart then
  shows the full history again and catches up on what it missed. Starting further back than
  the loaded history loads the older bars first (the chart returns to its usual depth
  afterwards), and calling `start()` again while replaying jumps backward or forward. A
  start inside the bars already on screen is immediate, even while the source is still
  streaming older history in; that history joins the replay as it lands. Switching the
  timeframe keeps the replay going at the same point in time — without showing a coarser
  bar that had not closed yet — and keeps playing if it was.
  `chart.replay.bounds` tells how far back and forward a replay can go, and the `replay:*`
  events let an interface follow along. In the widget and the workspace, a replaying chart
  shows a "Replay" line under its symbol watermark (the new Replay watermark switch in
  chart settings, next to Symbol watermark, turns it off), and its status line wears a
  replay badge in place of the market status.
- **Bar replay across a multi-chart layout.** `workspace.replay` rewinds every chart of a
  workspace at once and plays them back on one clock: each chart shows exactly the bars that
  had closed by the shared replay time, so charts on different timeframes or markets never
  reveal the future to one another, and the finest timeframe sets the pace. Charts added to
  the layout join the replay, a chart switching symbol rejoins it, and it ends on every
  chart together. Contributions drive it as `ctx.replay`.
- **Tick replay.** `chart.replay.setTicks(source)` plays each revealed bar the way a live
  one forms: your source hands over the bar's intrabar updates, and the candle opens, moves
  and stretches through them before settling exactly on the stored bar, with indicators
  following every update. The play pace then counts updates, not bars. Updates can come
  from anywhere; `lowerTimeframeTicks(chart, '1')` builds them from the chart's own
  provider, one per finer bar. `stepUpdate()` reveals one update at a time, and the new
  `replay:tick` event reports progress within a bar.
- **Building blocks for pick-a-point interactions.** The UI kit gains `DatePicker`, the
  month calendar with month and year jumps in its header that indicator date inputs
  already use, now available to your own interfaces. The new `crosshairOverride` renderer
  feature restyles the crosshair while the user picks something on the chart — a solid
  line in your color, the horizontal level hidden, and optionally the area after it veiled
  (`shadeRight`) — without touching the saved chart settings. A synced crosshair from
  another chart takes the same look, so a pick can span several charts.
- **Plugins can dock a strip under the charts.** `ctx.dockStrip(el)` on the widget context
  places your element as a full-width strip between the charts and the bottom bar; the
  charts shrink to make room, and the returned function takes it away again.
- **Plugins choose where an action sits on mobile, and hear taps.** A topbar action's new
  `mobile` option puts it on the bottom bar or in the three-dots menu (a primary action
  lands right after Layout there). `chart.renderer.onClick` reports a click or a touch tap
  on the plot with the bar under it — on touch, where a tap moves no crosshair, the way
  to learn which bar was chosen.

### Changed

- **Reading history no longer gets interrupted by new bars.** When the newest bar is
  scrolled off the right edge, a new bar (live or replayed) leaves the view on the bars
  you were looking at; at the right edge, the chart keeps following the newest bar.

### Fixed

- **The status line's ticker no longer stands apart from its venue.** The dot after the
  ticker now sits one space away from it, as far as the venue sits after the dot, instead
  of a wide gap.

## [0.7.8]

### Fixed

- **The RTH/ETH switch and the exchange time zone appear as the chart loads, not after it.**
  Picking a market with trading sessions used to leave the bottom bar's session switch
  hidden until the new candles had finished loading, plus a further round trip — the
  metadata that decides it was fetched again, from scratch, once everything else was done.
  The symbol's metadata is now read while the candles load, and the five things that need
  it (the price scale's tick size, the market-status badge, the session shading, the
  session switch, the time zone) share a single request whose answer is reused for ten
  minutes. A switch that used to open five identical requests now opens one.

### Added

- **Exchange in the chart settings' Time zone row.** In the widget and workspace, the Symbol
  tab's Time zone dropdown is now the same picker as the bottom bar — UTC, **Exchange**, then
  the catalog — so following the market is one pick away from the settings dialog too. The
  row writes the workspace choice (it never demotes the rule to a fixed zone); its
  visibility id is `time-zone` (`settings.hidden`). Host settings sections
  (`setSettingsSections`) may now give a `select` row `[value, label]` options.
- **Every built-in indicator is now fully styleable.** Each study splits its settings into
  a **Settings** and a **Style** section, and every element it draws gets its own color:
  Bollinger Bands ink the basis, the bands and the fill separately, MACD's histogram has
  four colors for rising and falling on each side of zero, and the moving averages,
  channels and cumulative volume lines can be colored by their own slope or by which side
  of the line price is trading. Every setting carries a tooltip explaining what it does.
- **Overbought and oversold levels are inputs, not fixed lines.** RSI, Stochastic,
  Stochastic RSI, Williams %R, Money Flow Index, Connors RSI, the Chande Momentum
  Oscillator, the Ultimate Oscillator and the Relative Volatility Index all let you move
  their thresholds, and the shaded zones, dashed level lines and line coloring follow. The
  bounded oscillators blend their line from the oversold color through neutral to the
  overbought color, and shade the region beyond each threshold; the centered ones wash the
  area between the reading and the zero line, fading out where the two meet.
- **More moving averages and more display modes.** The Moving Average study offers
  thirteen smoothings — adding Hull, Arnaud Legoux, double and triple exponential,
  Kaufman adaptive, least-squares, McGinley and Hamming — plus an optional second average
  with its own type, length, source and color. Linear Regression can plot its curve or its
  slope; Rate of Change can plot a percentage or a raw momentum difference; SMI Ergodic can
  plot its lines or its histogram; Intraday Intensity can plot the normalized oscillator or
  the cumulative line; Pivot Points offers Traditional, Fibonacci, Camarilla and Woodie
  ladders on an automatic or explicit anchor; and the Average True Range, Volume Flow
  Indicator, Relative Volatility Index and Price Volume Trend let you pick their smoothing.
- **New options on the classics.** Chandelier Exit can ratchet its stops, Balance of Power
  and On Balance Volume can be smoothed, Bollinger Bands Width marks its squeeze and bulge
  references, the Ulcer Index can show the raw drawdown behind it, 52 Week High/Low can add
  the all-time high and low, and VWAP offers percentage bands beside its deviation bands.

### Changed

- **The built-in indicators now match their reference builds.** Defaults, formulas and
  looks were aligned study by study, so several read differently than before: Stochastic
  smooths %K over 3 bars instead of 1, Zero-Lag EMA defaults to 21, Connors RSI flags
  90/10 rather than 80/20, Historical Volatility annualizes over 252 periods on a sample
  deviation, and SuperTrend, the Klinger Oscillator, the Ulcer Index, the Hull average and
  Williams Fractal were corrected to their published definitions. Bollinger Bands Width and
  TRIX are no longer rescaled, so their values are smaller than before.
  _(Breaking: VWAP's per-band color and fill settings collapse into one bullish, one
  bearish and one band color, its Day anchor is now called Session, and it hides itself on
  daily and higher timeframes unless you turn that guard off. The Moving Average type
  `RMA` is now listed as `RMA (SMMA)`, though charts saved with the old name still load.)_

## [v0.7.7]

### Added

- **Exchange time zone.** The time-zone picker (bottom bar, time-axis menu, mobile sheet)
  offers an **Exchange** row, right under UTC: pick it and every chart renders in its own market's
  zone — Chicago for a CME future, New York for a US equity, UTC for crypto — as declared
  by its provider. In a multi-chart grid each cell follows its own market, and the
  bottom-bar clock shows the active chart's. The choice persists with the workspace and
  can be set from code with `timezone: 'exchange'` or `setTimezone('exchange')`;
  choosing a fixed zone anywhere returns the whole workspace to that zone.
- **The date picker jumps to a month or year from its header.** In an indicator's time
  input, the calendar month and year are buttons: click the month to pick from the twelve
  months, or the year to pick from a decade. Choosing a year then a month returns you to
  the days, so a far date is a few clicks instead of stepping month by month.
- **Chart margins are now a setting.** The Canvas tab of the chart settings gains a
  Margins group: the empty space kept above the highest and below the lowest visible
  value (each as a percent of the pane's height, 0–40) and the whitespace after the
  newest bar (in bars, 0–200). The vertical margins apply to every pane; the right
  margin is where the chart lands on load, on a symbol or timeframe switch, and when you
  scroll back to the latest bar — editing it moves the view there right away. The values
  live in the chart config as `margins`, so saved templates and persisted charts carry
  them. The defaults are 10 % / 10 % / 10 bars.

### Changed

- **Default chart margins.** The autoscaled window now keeps 10 % of the pane above and
  below the data (previously 20 % above, 10 % below), and the chart lands 10 bars from
  the right edge instead of 6. Set the Margins group on the Canvas tab to 20 / 10 / 6 to
  restore the previous look.
- **A strategy's round trips can now carry their own ledger.** Each trade an engine
  reports through a script's execution context (`trades`) may include its realized
  `pnl`, the `commission` charged, and its worst and best excursion from entry
  (`maxDrawdown`, `maxRunup`) — the per-trade counterparts of the account-level
  drawdown and run-up the strategy summary already exposed. All four are optional, so
  an engine that tracks none of them keeps reporting trades exactly as before; a host
  tabulating a backtest no longer has to reconstruct them from fills.

### Fixed

- **Dragging an indicator input's opacity slider commits once, on release.** The picker
  emitted a new value on every pointer move, so an `input.color` slider drag in an
  indicator's settings re-executed the script over its whole history once per frame —
  the color looked frozen while the engine caught up, and a long drag on a deep history
  could exhaust the tab's memory. Indicator inputs now hear the final value when the
  pointer is released (the knob, gradient and percentage still follow it live; a plain
  click on the track commits at the clicked position as before). Drawing styles and chart
  settings keep their live preview: they only repaint. The policy is the new
  `commit: 'live' | 'release'` option of `buildColorPicker` / `ColorField` / the
  `color` field descriptor (default `'live'`), for hosts whose `onChange` recomputes
  rather than repaints.

## [v0.7.6]

### Added

- **Bring your own indicator ids.** `addIndicator`, `runIndicator` and `runScript` accept an
  `id` option — an opaque string of your choosing (a document key, an editor tab, a UUID).
  The indicator then runs under that id everywhere the chart reports one: the handle,
  `chart.indicators()`, the `indicator:*` events, `script:run`, the legend and the pane
  attributes — so a host that keys its own state on indicators no longer needs a side map
  from its ids to the chart's. Leave it out and the chart mints an id as before; nothing
  existing changes. An id already live on the chart is rejected rather than renamed:
  `addIndicator` throws, `runIndicator`/`runScript` resolve `{ ok: false, error }`.
  Removing the indicator frees its id. In the widget, `ctx.addIndicator({ id, … })` and
  a persistence handler's `CellStateContext.addIndicator({ id, … })` take the same id,
  so a plugin can store it in its document slot and restore the indicator under it —
  and undo/redo re-add an indicator under the id it first ran with, supplied or minted.

## [v0.7.5]

### Added

- **Timeline-mark groups can nest.** A group may name a `parent`: its checkbox lists indented
  under the parent's on the Events tab and dims while the parent is off, and its marks paint
  only while both are on. A host can now offer one master switch with sub-choices — News →
  most recent / historical, Economic releases → high / medium / low — and a child keeps its
  own choice for when the parent comes back.

### Fixed

- **Two-letter mark tokens stay inside their outline.** A timeline mark carrying two
  characters (`US`, `EU`) drew them at the single-letter size, so on a 16 px pin the pair
  ran over the head. Pairs now share the token's width at a smaller size, and are measured
  as drawn so a wider pair or a wider host font never overflows either; a single letter is
  unchanged.

- **"Reset defaults" keeps the chart type you are on.** Resetting the chart settings
  used to switch the chart back to the style it had when the page loaded — a line,
  Heikin Ashi, or plugin chart type went back to candles, while the style button in the
  toolbar still showed the old pick and the chart type's own settings tab vanished with
  it. The reset now leaves the current chart type in place and returns everything else
  to its defaults — every tab, the chart type's own settings, the candle look you gave
  a plugin chart type from the Symbol tab, and the event groups you had hidden. The
  dialog stays put and simply shows the restored values, instead of closing and
  opening again. The toolbar's style button also follows a chart type that arrives
  through an imported settings template.

## [v0.7.4]

### Changed

- **The price scale stays on the price range while the chart is hidden.** Hiding the
  chart from the symbol legend with nothing else on the price pane used to leave the
  price axis on a 0–1 placeholder. The axis now keeps following the hidden bars as you
  pan and zoom, so showing the chart again lands exactly where you left it. As before,
  when overlay indicators remain on the pane they take the scale over and fill it.

### Fixed

- **Dense timeline marks fold into clusters as you zoom out.** Marks of one group used to
  fold only when they landed on the same bar, so a busy feed on a fine timeframe drew a
  solid band of overlapping glyphs. Neighbouring marks whose glyphs would overlap at the
  current bar spacing now share one glyph: the tooltip carries the count, the popup lists
  every mark, and zooming back in separates them again.

## [v0.7.3]

### Fixed

- **Hiding the chart hides a plugin chart type whole.** With a plugin chart type
  selected, hiding the chart from the symbol legend removed the candles but left the
  chart type's own drawing on the pane. The chart type now disappears together with the
  candles — everything the current chart type paints, its hover readouts included — and
  comes back on show. Overlay plugin indicators that draw through a renderer layer are
  unaffected: they stay visible while the chart is hidden, whatever the chart type.

## [v0.7.2]

### Fixed

- **Hiding the chart no longer blanks plugin layers drawn at bar prices.** Hiding the
  candles from the symbol legend used to empty the price pane whenever what remained on
  it was drawn by a plugin renderer layer — a plugin chart type, or an overlay plugin
  indicator painting through its own layer: with no series left to measure, the price
  scale collapsed and those layers painted off-screen. The bars now keep driving the
  price scale while such content is on the pane, so the candles disappear and everything
  else stays exactly where it was.

## [v0.7.1]

### Added

- **Replace an indicator's script in place.** `handle.updateCode(source)` re-runs an
  indicator on new code without taking it off the chart: it keeps its identity, legend
  row, pane placement, visibility and any handle you hold, and input values carry over
  wherever the new script still declares them. The new source is compiled before the
  running one is stopped, so a script that fails to compile leaves the current indicator
  computing and painting and reports through the handle's `error` event. Runs caused this
  way report `cause: 'code'` on `script:run`. Native indicators, which have no script,
  ignore the call.
- **Plugin indicators drawn by a renderer layer can now be added several times.** A
  plugin native indicator that paints through its own renderer layer and allows several
  instances (`multiInstance` on its descriptor) now gets one layer per instance: each
  instance draws on its own canvas, on its own pane, with its own stacking order, and its
  data never overwrites a sibling's. Previously such types had to stay single-instance.
  Running native indicators also learn their own id (`ctx.id`), so an instance can
  identify itself to host code — a picker or a drag handle — without ambiguity.
- **A plot can show on some surfaces and not others.** An indicator series now carries
  a per-surface `display`: painted in its pane, kept on the price scale, its value beside
  the legend title, and its row in the data window are four independent switches. A
  script can keep a helper value readable in the data window without drawing it, show a
  value in the legend only, or paint a line that reports nowhere. The `visible: false`
  shorthand still hides a series everywhere. Renderer and plugin authors resolve the
  flags with `seriesShownOn` and `seriesInScale` from `@luxalgo/vela/plugin`.

### Changed

- **Hidden plots no longer stretch the price scale.** A series that is neither painted
  in its pane nor shown on the price scale — a data-window-only or legend-only readout,
  or a `visible: false` fill anchor — is left out of the pane's autoscale, so a helper
  plot far from the drawn values no longer squashes what is actually visible. A plot
  shown on the price scale keeps its values in view even when it is not painted.

### Fixed

- **Candle wicks keep their color when zoomed far out.** Once bars are packed tighter
  than a pixel, the candles sharing a column are drawn as thin sticks; a stick used to
  take one direction for all of its bars, so a bearish candle's long wick could turn
  bullish green the moment the recovery candle next to it landed in the same column.
  Each bar's range now keeps its own color — direction, `barcolor()` tint, or the
  wick color from the candle settings, the same rules as at every other zoom level.
- **A plugin indicator restored hidden no longer crashes the chart on load.** A saved
  layout that carried a hidden plugin native indicator could throw while the chart was
  being built, because the indicator was asked to suspend before it had ever started.
  Such an indicator is now left alone until it is first shown, at which point it starts
  as usual; removing it or closing the chart while it is still hidden is equally safe.
- **Right-click menus and dropdowns follow the app theme, not the plot.** Changing the
  chart background in settings used to recolor those panels with the plot. They now
  use the same surface as the drawing toolbar and the chart settings dialog, and only
  a theme switch restyles them.
- **An edit made just before a workspace is torn down is no longer lost.** Changes are
  batched for a moment before `state:changed` fires, and destroying the workspace inside
  that window used to drop the pending change without telling anyone — so an app saving
  from that event lost the user's last symbol change or added indicator. `destroy()` now
  emits the pending `state:changed` before tearing anything down, and `getState()` called
  during teardown still describes the charts that were on screen rather than the last
  restored document.
- **Timeline mark popups now toggle with a click.** Clicking the mark whose popup is
  open closes it; previously that second click closed and immediately reopened the popup,
  so it took a click elsewhere to dismiss it.
- **Three-point tools preview their first line right away.** The pitchfork family
  (Andrews', Schiff, modified Schiff, inside) and the triangle now draw a line from the
  first placed point to the cursor as soon as the first click lands, instead of showing
  only the anchor markers until the second point is placed. The Schiff and modified
  Schiff pitchforks also keep that pivot line in the finished shape, so the pivot handle
  no longer floats detached from the fork it defines.
- **Indicator visuals no longer linger across a market switch.** Switching the symbol,
  timeframe, or session now clears every indicator's painted output the moment the
  switch starts, and each indicator repaints once its recomputation over the new market
  completes. Previously, outputs that are not tied to the bar series — drawing objects
  such as lines, boxes, labels, and polylines, plus background tints and horizontal
  levels — could stay visible over the new market's candles until the script finished
  recomputing, which for heavy scripts took many seconds.

## [v0.7.0]

### Added

- **Timeline marks — events on the chart.** `chart.marks` pins host events (dividends,
  splits, earnings, news, releases…) to the bar they belong to and shows them as small
  outlined tokens — a letter or an icon in the event's color — on a lane just above the
  time axis. A token swells briefly under the pointer and fills with its color while its
  popup is open. Clicking one opens a popup centered on the token, with a short fade,
  showing the event's title and details: plain text, formatted HTML (sanitized), or a
  panel of fields and buttons — and the details can load on demand. Several events of
  one kind on the same bar fold into one slightly larger token that lists them all;
  events of different kinds on one bar stack into a small deck that fans out on hover
  (or a tap) so each can be opened. Marks follow the bars: switch timeframes and they
  re-snap and regroup. Every kind of event gets its own checkbox on a new **Events** tab
  of the chart settings, and the choice is saved with the chart. Hosts hear every click
  through the new `mark:click` event, and the playground pages carry a sample set.
- **Popovers can center on their trigger and fade.** The UI kit's `Popover` accepts
  `align: 'center'` and a `fadeMs` duration for a short fade in and out — what the
  timeline-mark popup uses.
- **Native indicators can opt out of the legend.** A native indicator registered with
  `legend: false` paints its output with no in-chart chrome: no legend row (no title
  chip, no eye/gear/✕, not counted by the fold chip) and no entry in `panes.list()`, so
  the object tree shows nothing either. It is for host-owned overlays — journal trade
  markers, event flags — whose on/off switch lives in the host's own UI; the host keeps
  controlling the indicator through its handle. Hidden indicators are unchanged: they
  keep their row so the user can unhide them.
- **Every chart motion is now yours to tune or switch off.** The `animations` option
  covers each eased motion on its own — the wheel zoom, the pan momentum after a drag
  release, the scroll glide behind the scroll-to-latest button and keyboard pans, the
  price scale's glide while zooming, the live-bar glide, and the candle reveal on first
  load. Each accepts `true` (the built-in feel), `false` (instant), or a duration in
  milliseconds; the reveal also takes a style (`'settle'` or `'grow'`) and a sweep
  duration. Every one is also a live renderer feature (`chart.renderer.set('animZoom',
150)`), and the settings dialog's _Symbol → Animation_ group gains on/off switches
  for zoom, pan momentum, the price scale, and the reveal alongside the existing
  _Animate price changes_ — switching a motion back on restores the duration you
  configured, and the switches ride `getConfig()`/`applyConfig()` like every other
  setting. Turning zoom animation off applies to the keyboard zoom keys too.

### Changed

- **`animZoom` and `animPan` now read back as durations.** The two renderer features
  return their ease time in milliseconds (`0` = off) instead of a boolean, matching
  `animLiveBar`; `true`/`false` are still accepted when setting them. _(Breaking: code
  comparing the read value to `true`/`false` should test it for zero instead — a plain
  truthiness check keeps working.)_ `animations: false` now also skips the first-load
  candle reveal; pass `{ intro: true }` alongside the other switches to keep it.

### Fixed

- **Indicators restored hidden are reachable again.** An indicator added and hidden
  before it ever ran (a restored ledger/ext entry — a hidden native, or a hidden
  library/Pine script) mounted no legend row at all: invisible AND unreachable, with
  no eye to unhide it. Hidden adds now mount a dimmed placeholder row (no spinner)
  and announce immediately, so the legend eye and host UIs (object tree) can reach
  them; showing starts the instance via the v0.6.21 `started` path and the first
  computed model remounts over the placeholder.

- **The countdown to bar close keeps step with the clock.** The price-axis countdown
  chip and the workspace's bottom-bar clock now tick from one shared second pulse, so
  the two can no longer read different seconds; the remaining time rounds up, so a
  clock at `:54` sits beside `00:06` instead of `00:05`; and the chip disappears the
  moment the bar closes rather than parking at `00:00` until the next bar arrives.
  Hosts embedding a single chart can feed their own clock through
  `chart.renderer.setWallClock` to get the same alignment.

- **The mobile bar's maximize stop only shows when there is something to maximize.**
  In a multi-chart workspace switched to a one-chart layout, the stop used to stay in
  the bar as a dead press; it now disappears with the extra charts and returns when
  the layout grows again.

- **Chart-settings dropdowns no longer overflow on mobile.** A long option such as
  `Regular hours (RTH)` or `(UTC-5) Chicago` wrapped onto several lines inside its
  dropdown and spilled over the neighboring rows. The closed value now stays on one
  line, and on mobile the dropdown widens to fit it (up to a cap) before ellipsizing.

## [v0.6.21]

### Fixed

- Native indicators restored HIDDEN no longer crash (volume/VPVR `resume`/`setInputs`
  dereferenced a null context before `start`) and now START on un-hide instead of
  resuming a never-started instance — previously the show path either crashed or left
  a permanently blank row. Same pre-start family as the classic-indicator guard in
  v0.6.20.
- The constructor's volume auto-add intent reads object-form ledger entries
  (`{ type: 'volume', hidden: true }` was missed by the bare-string check).

### Added

- A ChartCell persistence regression harness (jsdom): boots a real cell with a fake
  renderer/feed and locks the dehydrate/rehydrate round-trip — stored-input seeds,
  delta/hidden capture, drifted-chart convergence, legacy-ledger resets, the
  visibility save trigger, and un-hide starting never-started natives.

## [v0.6.20]

### Added

- **Native indicator settings and visibility persist.** The workspace ledger's native
  entries carry input DELTAS and a `hidden` flag (manifest entries carry `hidden` too),
  the legend eye marks the state dirty, and `ctx.addIndicator` accepts `hidden` so
  plugin restores can apply it. Restores converge kept indicators to the document's
  values; legacy bare-string ledgers still restore unchanged. (#146, #149)

### Fixed

- Classic native indicators no longer compute against unloaded bars when a restore
  applies stored inputs before the first data lands (a pre-start guard in
  `ClassicIndicator`; the orchestrator replays the values at `start`). (#149)

## [v0.6.19]

## [v0.6.18]

### Added

- **Duplicate drawings by dragging, and select several at once.** Hold **Ctrl/Cmd** and
  drag a drawing's body to pull a copy away from it: the original stays where it is, the
  copy follows the cursor and is committed when you release — selected, with its
  quick-settings popup open — as one undo step; press **Escape** mid-drag and nothing is
  left behind. The quick-settings popup's overflow menu gains a **Duplicate** entry that
  clones the drawing in place and hands it the selection, ready to drag. Selection also
  grows beyond one drawing: **Ctrl/Cmd+click**
  adds a drawing to (or removes it from) the selection, just as Shift+click does, and
  **Ctrl/Cmd+drag on an empty spot** sweeps a selection box that picks up every drawing
  it touches — successive boxes accumulate, and a click on an empty spot clears the
  selection (while Ctrl/Cmd is held, handles mark only what is selected, not what the
  cursor passes over). Dragging the body of any selected drawing then moves the whole
  selection together (locked drawings stay put), Ctrl/Cmd+dragging it copies the whole
  selection, and Delete, the arrow keys, copy, duplicate and a middle-click on a selected
  drawing act on all of them, each as a single undo step. A lock protects a drawing inside
  a group: deleting a multi-selection removes only its unlocked members and leaves the
  locked ones in place, still selected. The object tree highlights every selected drawing,
  not just the first, and the `drawing:selected` event now carries the full list as `ids`
  alongside the primary `id`.
- **One settings popup for a whole selection.** Selecting several drawings opens a single
  quick-settings popup for all of them, showing only the controls every one of them
  supports — three trend lines get the full trend-line bar; a trend line, a box and a text
  annotation share just their common ground, and anything a member lacks disappears rather
  than showing disabled. Where the drawings agree a control reads normally; where they
  differ it reads as mixed — a swatch striped with every color in use, a dash in a
  dropdown, a half-lit toggle. Any edit applies to every selected drawing as one undo step,
  and opening a mixed swatch lists the colors currently in use first, so unifying onto one
  of them is a single click.

### Changed

- **The status line adapts to the chart's width in steps.** On a wide chart the symbol,
  venue, timeframe and market status share one line with the full O/H/L/C readout and
  the bar change. As the chart narrows, the values first move to a second line under the
  symbol, then drop the open, high and low to keep only the close and the change, and
  finally keep just the close and its percent change — so the readout stays legible
  instead of overflowing the plot. Multi-chart cells and phone-width charts follow the
  same steps; a cell too narrow for even the shortest readout hides it rather than
  clipping it.
- **The built-in VWAP now carries standard-deviation bands.** Volume Weighted Average
  Price draws up to three ±k·σ band pairs around the average — a Bands group gives each
  band its own on/off toggle and multiplier on one row (band 1 is on by default at 1σ;
  bands 2 and 3 wait at 2σ and 3σ) — with a soft fill between each pair. The reset
  period gains **Quarter** and **Year** beside Day, Week and Month, and Source now
  offers the same choices as the moving averages (Close, Open, High, Low, HL2, HLC3,
  OHLC4, HLCC4). A Style group at the bottom of the settings holds the VWAP color and,
  per band, its own color (each band starts in a distinct ink) with a Fill switch and the
  fill's own color — opacity included — beside it. Existing saved VWAP settings keep
  working: the period, source and line color keys are unchanged.
- **The object tree names indicators by their compact title.** An indicator that
  declares a short title now shows it on its row in the object tree, so the row reads
  the same as its legend chip. Indicators without a short title keep their full name,
  and a study pane's heading still carries the full name of the indicator that owns it.

### Fixed

- **The symbol menu and the timeframe menu no longer lose keystrokes when you type
  fast.** Typing straight onto the chart opens the symbol menu (letters) or the
  timeframe menu (digits) seeded with what you typed. The second key used to vanish
  when it arrived before the menu's field had taken focus, leaving only the first
  character; every key now reaches the menu.

## [v0.6.17]

### Changed

- **The live candle now snaps to each tick by default, and its glide is yours to tune.**
  On a streaming chart the forming candle used to slide toward every new price over a
  short, fixed ease. That slide is now a setting — `animations: { liveBar }` at
  construction, or `chart.renderer.set('animLiveBar', …)` live — and it is **off by
  default**, so the painted candle, the current-price line and its axis label always
  show the real latest values. Set `liveBar: true` to bring the slide back, or give it
  a duration in milliseconds to make it as quick or as gentle as your feed calls for
  (a slow feed reads well with a longer glide; a busy one with a short one). The chart
  settings dialog gets a matching **Animate price changes** switch in a new _Animation_
  group of the _Symbol_ tab (with a hint explaining it), saved with the rest of the chart's settings and templates; switching it back
  on reuses the duration you configured. A new bar always opens without a glide, and
  the crosshair, legend and data window show the real values at all times.
  `animations: false` keeps disabling every animation at once.
  _(Breaking: charts that relied on the previous always-on slide now snap; pass
  `animations: { liveBar: true }` to restore it.)_

## [v0.6.16]

### Added

- **A built-in catalog of classic indicators.** The indicators dialog now ships
  more than seventy standard technical-analysis studies out of the box — moving
  averages (Simple and Exponential as their own studies, a switchable
  SMA/EMA/WMA/RMA/VWMA study, ZLEMA, VIDYA, envelopes, linear regression),
  bands and channels (Bollinger Bands with %B and Width, Keltner, Donchian,
  SuperTrend, Chandelier Exit, Williams Alligator), momentum oscillators (RSI,
  Stochastic and Stochastic RSI, MACD, CCI, Awesome Oscillator, TSI, TRIX,
  Fisher Transform, Schaff Trend Cycle, Ultimate Oscillator and more), trend
  and volatility studies (ADX, Aroon, Vortex, ATR, Historical Volatility,
  Choppiness Index), volume studies (OBV, Accumulation/Distribution, Chaikin
  Money Flow, Money Flow Index, Klinger, volume oscillators — bars without a
  volume report show gaps, never fake zeros), and price-anchored specials
  (Parabolic SAR, VWAP, Pivot Points, 52 Week High/Low, ZigZag, Williams
  Fractal). Every study computes from the chart's own bars — no scripting
  engine needed — and gets the full indicator treatment: its own pane or a
  price overlay, legend row, a settings dialog with typed inputs and colors,
  and persistence across reloads. Studies stack: pick the same one again to
  add another instance (a 20 and a 200 moving average side by side), each
  with its own settings and its own row in the indicators dialog.

### Fixed

- **The custom color chooser stays open while you pick.** Pressing `+` in a color
  picker opens the browser's own color chooser; clicking or dragging on its
  gradient used to slam it shut after the first change, so you could only ever
  land one step away from where you started. The chooser now stays open until
  you dismiss it, the chart previews every color you hover through, and only the
  color you settle on is added to the recents row. Picking a swatch also updates
  the chooser's starting color, so `+` opens on what is currently selected.
- **The first result in the symbol search is no longer clipped.** Since the search
  bar and market tabs started staying pinned, they sat a few pixels too low and
  covered the top of the first row and its highlight. The row now shows in full,
  with its usual spacing under the tabs. On a phone, the result list scrolls on
  its own under the pinned search bar, and browsing past the first hundred
  results loads more as you scroll, as it does on desktop.

## [v0.6.15]

### Added

- **Side panels can float over the chart.** A contributed side panel may now
  declare `overlay: true` (`registerSidePanel`) to open over the chart's right
  edge instead of docking beside it — the chart keeps its width and layout, and
  the panel covers whatever sits under it. Meant for panels wide enough that a
  docked column would crush the plot, such as a code editor. A floating panel
  shows a pin in its header: press it to dock the panel as a column beside the
  chart, press again to let it float — your choice is remembered with the rest
  of the layout. Resizing, the double-click reset and width persistence behave
  the same in both placements; docking stays the default.

### Changed

- **Panel resize handles highlight in the theme's own ink.** Hovering or dragging
  a side panel's edge now shows the same neutral line the workspace grid
  splitters and pane separators use (light on a dark theme, dark on a light one)
  instead of the accent blue.
- **The crosshair's time label spells out the date.** Hovering a bar now
  labels the time axis with the weekday, day, month, and year — for example
  `Sun 30 Aug '26 19:00` — instead of a bare month-day and clock, so a stamp
  reads unambiguously however far back you scroll. On daily and longer
  timeframes the clock is omitted and only the date shows. The time and
  price chips also sit on a brighter, warmer gray so they stand off the
  axis more clearly.
- **Symbol search shows letters in uppercase.** Typed queries and ticker names
  in the results list display in uppercase — the same case a letter typed on
  the chart already seeds the dialog with. Descriptions, tabs, and the
  placeholder stay mixed case.

### Fixed

- **Side panels come back the way you left them.** With the default
  (localStorage) persistence, the open side panel and the widths you had dragged
  were saved but not restored on the next load — the column always started
  closed. They are restored at start-up now, along with the new pinned
  placements.
- **Overnight extended sessions now shade as one session, and the status
  badge says so.** Markets whose extended session runs through midnight —
  the trading day opens in the evening and closes the next afternoon — were
  painted with the pre-market wash before the regular open and the
  post-market wash after the close, a split that doesn't exist for them, with
  the color flipping at midnight in the middle of the session; the Sunday
  evening open wasn't shaded at all. Those markets now paint one continuous
  extended-hours wash across the whole overnight (Sunday evening included),
  with its own color in the Trading session settings, and the status badge
  reads "Extended Hours" instead of "Pre-Market" / "Post-Market". Markets
  with a same-day pre/post split keep their colors and badges unchanged.
  Session shading edges also now fall exactly between two candles — the last
  one inside the session and the first one outside — instead of cutting
  through a candle.
- **A multi-chart screenshot now captures the whole layout.** The camera
  button, its keyboard chord, and the mobile drawer used to export only the
  active chart. They now download every visible chart in its grid slot, with
  the seams between them. A maximized cell still exports that one chart, and
  a single-chart workspace is unchanged.
- **Opening the symbol search on a phone no longer zooms the page.** iOS
  Safari enlarges the view when a focused field is under 16px and often
  leaves it there after you pick a symbol. Mobile text fields are now 16px,
  so the tap does not zoom. The search bar and market tabs also stay pinned
  while you scroll the results.
- **A price gap stays visible at every zoom level.** When the two candles on
  either side of a large price jump landed in the same pixel column on a far
  zoom-out, that column rendered as one solid stick bridging the empty price
  range between them. The zoomed-out view now keeps the gap open and paints
  each side separately, each with its own up/down color.
- **Chart screenshots now include the corner attribution mark.** The mark in
  the bottom-left corner of the plot — Vela's own or the custom one a host
  supplies — appeared on screen but was missing from the PNG the screenshot
  export produced. Exports now show it exactly where the chart does; charts
  with the mark disabled export unchanged.

## [v0.6.14]

### Changed

- **The first paint of a progressive load now waits for 20 bars instead
  of 100.** The first paint is the frame the view is sized against, so a
  2-3 bar head would draw a few giant candles; but the old 100-bar hold kept
  monthly charts of short-lived contracts — whose whole history holds fewer
  bars — blank until the data source's polling budget ran out (up to ~90 s).
  Twenty bars frame a readable view on every timeframe, deeper snapshots
  repaint with the viewport preserved, and the final answer still paints
  whatever depth exists.

## [v0.6.12]

### Fixed

- **An indicator added before its chart has bars no longer strands in a wrong,
  empty sub pane.** When the initial bar load resolves empty (a slow feed, an
  authentication race, an unresolved symbol) and a script indicator is added in
  that window — typically by a host restoring a saved layout — its first run
  produces nothing. That empty first result used to be taken as the script's
  real output: the indicator was moved off its declared pane into a new sub
  pane with a generic "Indicator" legend title, and it stayed there with no
  plots even after the data arrived. While the chart itself is still without
  bars, such a result now keeps the indicator loading on the pane its
  declaration asked for, and the first run over real data places, titles, and
  announces it exactly as if the data had been there from the start. Loading
  still ends with the run, not with output: a script that runs over real bars
  and simply draws nothing (alerts only, for example) finishes loading as
  before.
- **Extended boxes no longer squeeze the price scale from off-screen.** A box
  drawn with a one-sided extension (`extend.right` or `extend.left`) contributes
  its prices to the automatic price scale only while some painted part of it —
  the anchor span or the side its extension actually covers — crosses the
  visible bars. Previously any extended box counted everywhere on the time
  axis, so an indicator keeping a box near the latest bars (a common
  order-block idiom) flattened the candles in every earlier window the moment
  you scrolled back in history. Boxes extended toward the window, and
  `extend.both` boxes, still scale into view as before.

### Added

- **30-minute and monthly presets in the timeframe picker.** The default
  timeframe list is now `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1D`, `1W`, `1M`.
  Hosts passing their own `timeframes` option are unaffected. The offline feed
  also ticks at the right cadence for monthly bars instead of falling back to
  hourly.

- **Right-click the status line to shape it.** The in-chart status line now opens
  an action menu on right-click with a toggle for each of its elements — the new
  symbol logo toggle (also in the settings dialog's Status line tab), the symbol
  name, the market status badge, the OHLC values, and the bar change — plus a
  hide/show for the chart's price series itself, the same switch as the object
  tree's eye. Hiding the symbol name also hides the venue and timeframe beside it,
  since the three read as one label. The line also behaves like the indicator
  legend rows around it: hovering outlines it, and while the chart is hidden it
  dims, drops its OHLC and change readouts, and shows an eye button that brings
  the chart back — everything returns exactly as configured.

## [v0.6.11]

### Fixed

- **The measure ruler follows the magnet, and a right-click always returns to
  the pointer.** While measuring, weak and strong magnet snap the ruler's
  endpoints to the nearest candle the same way they snap drawing anchors
  (Ctrl/Cmd still forces strong). A right-click now cancels whatever
  non-persistent tool is active — an in-progress placement or measurement, an
  armed drawing tool that hasn't placed an anchor yet, or the eraser — and
  returns to the pointer without opening the chart's context menu (Escape still
  cancels a measurement too). Persistent toggles — the magnet, stay-in-drawing
  mode, favorites — are untouched.

- **Extended lines no longer squeeze the price scale when nothing of them is in
  view.** A line contributes its anchor prices (`y1`/`y2`) to the automatic price
  scale only while some painted part of it — the anchor segment or its `extend`
  projection — actually crosses the visible bars, and the projection itself never
  contributes values of its own. In particular a vertical line (both points on
  the same bar, the common `extend.both` idiom) extends along itself, so once its
  bar scrolls out of view it stops pulling its price into the scale — previously
  a far-away anchor price kept flattening the candles from off-screen. Extended
  lines that do cross the window still scale into view by their anchor prices.
- **Multi-chart view controls sit on the candles.** The hover cluster that
  zooms, resets, and moves a chart now centers on the price plot — the area
  where the candles live — instead of the full cell, so the price scale on
  the right no longer pulls it off-center.

### Added

- **Magnifier drawing tool — see a finer timeframe inside an area.** Drag a
  rectangle over the chart (Measurements group) and its interior redraws the
  same market at a lower timeframe, in the chart's own style and colors —
  candles subdivide into finer candles, a line chart magnifies into a finer
  line, and Heikin Ashi stays Heikin Ashi — at their true time and price
  positions. The timeframe chip riding the rectangle's bottom-left corner is
  itself a dropdown: click it to switch, or use the same pick on the drawing's
  toolbar — both offer only timeframes below the chart's own. Auto picks a
  sensible subdivision of the chart's timeframe (a 1-hour chart magnifies into
  15-minute candles); the up/down colors and the border style stay editable
  when you want the inset to stand apart. The finer bars load in the
  background and the area keeps up with live data; if the area is too wide
  for the chosen timeframe, or the chart is already at the finest one, the
  tool says so inside the rectangle instead of guessing. Like every drawing
  it moves, resizes, clones, and persists with the document.

- **Scroll the price axis to rescale it.** The mouse wheel over the right
  price-axis strip now zooms that pane's scale the same way dragging it does —
  scroll up compresses the visible span, scroll down expands it, each notch a
  gentle step (about ×1.1) around the window's center. It follows the same
  `axisDrag` renderer feature as the drag, and a double-click still resets the
  scale to automatic. The axis' A (auto) chip reflects the switch the moment it
  happens — going manual on the first notch, lighting back up on reset — even
  with the cursor perfectly still.

- **Indicator input and prop edits survive a reload — as deltas.** Changing an
  indicator's settings used to live only in the running instance: a reload put
  every script back on its declaration defaults. The saved document now stores
  each instance's deviations, and only those, so a default that later changes
  in the script is never frozen into old documents. The ledger's manifest
  entries grow a value-carrying form — the bare name when everything sits on
  defaults, else `{ name, inputs?, props? }`. Restores thread those values
  through every add path, and a removal captures the current deltas first so
  undo/redo resurrection comes back with the values the user last saw.
  `IndicatorHandle` exposes `inputValues()` / `propValues()`, the orchestrator
  emits `indicator:inputs` on every value change (which now marks the document
  dirty, so input edits autosave like adds and removes always did), and
  `inputDeltas` joins the plugin SDK for state-persistence handlers.

### Changed

- **Switching the market keeps your zoom.** Changing the symbol or timeframe
  used to re-fit the view from scratch. The chart now keeps the bar spacing you
  had chosen and re-anchors the newest bars at the right edge — only the pan
  resets, since the previous position pointed at another market's time range.
  The very first chart still opens with the classic fit.

### Fixed

- **Extended lines no longer squeeze the price scale when nothing of them is in
  view.** A line contributes its anchor prices (`y1`/`y2`) to the automatic price
  scale only while some painted part of it — the anchor segment or its `extend`
  projection — actually crosses the visible bars, and the projection itself never
  contributes values of its own. In particular a vertical line (both points on
  the same bar, the common `extend.both` idiom) extends along itself, so once its
  bar scrolls out of view it stops pulling its price into the scale — previously
  a far-away anchor price kept flattening the candles from off-screen. Extended
  lines that do cross the window still scale into view by their anchor prices.
- **Progressively loaded symbols no longer open zoomed onto a handful of
  candles.** On data sources that stream history in while it heals, the first
  painted snapshot could carry only a few bars — and the view was framed onto
  them, leaving a few giant candles that later data never re-framed. The first
  paint now waits until the snapshot is deep enough to carry the framing (the
  complete answer always paints, however deep it is).

## [v0.6.10]

### Added

- **Per-chart view controls in the multi-chart workspace.** Rest the cursor near
  the bottom center of any chart and a small cluster of buttons appears — the
  same reveal as the jump-to-latest button: a drag handle, zoom out, zoom in,
  maximize, and reset. The drag handle moves the chart within the grid — hold
  it, sweep onto another chart (a dashed ring previews the target), and release
  to trade places. Maximize expands that one chart over the whole grid; the
  other charts keep everything and return instantly with the restore button
  (switching layouts restores too). Reset re-enables automatic price scaling
  and frames the full history, like the context menu's "Reset view". On mobile
  the hover cluster stays out of the way (as do the per-pane hover buttons) —
  the bottom bar gains a maximize stop instead, which isolates the current
  chart and lights up as an inverse chip whenever that chart covers the grid
  or one of its panes is maximized (a double-tap does that); pressing it while
  lit restores the view. Hosts can drive the same moves from code with
  `maximizeCell(id)` (and `null` to restore), `maximizedCell`,
  `swapCells(a, b)`, and the `cell:maximized` event.

### Changed

- **Legend callouts hide while the row is open.** Hovering or selecting an
  indicator legend now hides its callout bubble instead of sliding it to the
  end of the row, so the action buttons stay next to the title.
- **A maximized pane now shows its state.** While a pane is maximized, its
  restore button at the top-right reads as a lit chip (white on the dark theme,
  dark on the light one) and stays visible without hovering — the same
  affordance a collapsed pane's expand chip already had — so an isolated pane
  is recognizable at a glance.
- **Restacking an indicator now moves everything it paints.** Reordering an
  indicator from the object tree (or `seriesOrder`) repositions the whole
  indicator as one unit — plots, fills, lines, boxes, labels, markers, polylines,
  linefills, and tables — instead of only its plots. Fills paint at the
  indicator's own slot (a band raised above the price now tints over the
  candles), drawings and tables follow their indicator through the stack, and —
  since new indicators start under the price series — a fresh script's drawings
  begin behind the candles until you restack it. Tables are painted on the chart
  canvas now, so they obey the same order and appear in chart screenshots; cell
  tooltips keep working. Pine `bgcolor()` stays behind everything and
  `barcolor()` stays with the candles, as before.

### Fixed

- **Dropdown menus no longer fly in from the top of the page.** Opening a
  timeframe, style, or other menu now fades in at the trigger instead of
  sliding down from off-screen.
- **The Cursor button leaves the ruler and eraser.** Clicking Cursor on the drawing
  toolbar now returns to the regular pointer even while the measure ruler or the
  eraser is active; before, those modes stayed on and the click appeared to do
  nothing.
- **The attribution mark stays clear of collapsed panes in a workspace.** In the
  multi-chart workspace (and the single-chart shell built on it), collapsing an
  indicator pane at the bottom of the bottom-left chart left the shared
  attribution mark sitting on top of the collapsed strip's legend row. The mark
  now climbs above collapsed strips — the same behavior a standalone chart's own
  mark always had — and follows the maximized chart while one covers the grid.
- **Crisp rendering on fractional display scales.** On displays with a fractional
  zoom factor (a common Windows setting at 125% or 150%), candles, wicks,
  gridlines, and every other chart graphic could look slightly blurred: the
  chart's drawing surface was misaligned with the screen's physical pixels by a
  fraction of a pixel, which smeared every edge. The surface now snaps to the
  physical pixel grid, so edges render sharp at any display scale.
- **Pixel-perfect candle edges.** Candle bodies and wicks now pin their tops and
  bottoms to whole physical pixels, the same way their sides already snap. A
  magnified screenshot shows hard one-pixel edges all around a candle instead of
  a faint blended rim above and below the body.

## [v0.6.9]

### Added

- **Legend callout bubbles.** Plugins and host apps can now pin a small tinted
  bubble — a colored circle with a centered icon — next to an indicator's legend
  title (`registerLegendCallout`). The bubble shows a tooltip on hover, moves to
  the end of the row while the legend controls are out, and can be made clickable:
  a click deploys a panel of text and action buttons below the bubble (or above
  it when the screen edge is too close), with the buttons running any host action.
  The same bubble component powers the status line's market badge and is available
  from the UI kit for host chrome.
- **Declaration props: schema, overrides, and a "Properties" settings tab.** A
  scripting engine can now expose the mutable arguments of a script's declaration
  call (a strategy's `initial_capital`, `commission_value`, an indicator's
  `precision`, …) as a props schema (`PreparedScript.props`, announced by
  `capabilities.props`). Vela threads them end to end: `addIndicator(source,
{ props })` seeds add-time overrides, the indicator handle gains `props`,
  `setProp()` and `setProps()` (a prop change replays the whole script, like an
  input edit), execution requests carry the merged values (`ExecutionRequest.props`,
  `ExecutionSession.update(inputs, props?)`), and the in-chart settings dialog
  renders them on a trailing **Properties** tab with the same live-edit /
  Cancel / Reset-defaults semantics as inputs. Engines without props support are
  untouched — the tab only appears when the engine publishes a schema.

- **Pine label tooltips.** A label created with a `tooltip` now shows it: hover the
  label (the bubble, marker, or text) and a themed tip opens next to the cursor,
  wrapping long texts.
- **Bold and italic label text.** Labels accept the same bold/italic text
  formatting boxes already support, applied to bubble and plain text styles alike.
- **`force_overlay` content joins the price pane.** Model elements flagged
  `force_overlay` — value series, plotted candles and bars, fills, backgrounds,
  markers, and tables, like the drawing objects before them — now render on the
  price pane even when their indicator occupies its own pane, and they share the
  price scale (the pane's autoscale folds them in). `chart.inspect()` reports a
  `forcedOverlay` count per indicator so the routing is verifiable.

### Changed

- **The settings dialog shows the indicator's compact name.** An indicator that
  declares a short title (Pine `shorttitle`) now shows it in the settings-dialog
  header as well as the legend chip, so the two always match. While a script is
  still loading, its legend row identifies it by the full title and swaps to the
  compact name with the first computed result.

### Fixed

- **`barcolor()` respects the candle border setting.** A candle tinted by
  `barcolor()` no longer gets a forced outline in the up/down direction color:
  with borders disabled the tinted body renders flat, and with borders enabled an
  unconfigured border color follows the tint instead of the direction color, so
  heatmap-style recoloring reads as one solid hue. Explicitly configured border
  colors still apply.
- **Label `textalign` works on bubble styles.** Multi-line text inside a label
  bubble now aligns left, center, or right as asked; it was always centered.
- **Pine tables render with Pine's sizing and visibility rules.** An allocated
  table whose cells were never set no longer paints as an empty grid — it
  occupies no space until content arrives, and unused rows and columns of a
  partially filled table collapse instead of padding the layout. Cell text no
  longer wraps, so unicode sparklines and `━━━` divider rows stay on one line.
  A cell's `width`/`height` percentages now size the cell against the pane, an
  integer `text_size` renders at exactly that pixel size, and bold/italic cell
  formatting is honored. The table frame draws as a clean outer stroke around
  the table instead of an inset line that cell backgrounds could cover, and the
  origin cell of a merged region always paints — repeated `table.merge_cells`
  calls from a running script used to blank the merged title row.
- **Symbol and timeframe picks show instantly.** Choosing a new symbol or
  timeframe now updates the topbar, status line, and watermark the moment the
  pick is made instead of after the new market's bars finish loading — on a
  slow connection the loading chart carries the name you picked rather than
  the old market's.
- **A label with an `na` color keeps its style's placement.** A Pine label whose
  bubble color is `na` used to draw its text centered on the anchor no matter
  which style it declared, so `label.style_label_up` read like
  `label.style_label_center`. The text now sits exactly where the bubble would
  have put it — only the bubble itself goes unpainted.
- **Pre- and post-market shading stays off daily and higher timeframes.** On an
  extended-session chart the tint used to paint over daily, weekly, and monthly
  candles, even though each of those bars spans whole sessions and there is
  nothing to shade. The bands now appear only on intraday timeframes.
- **Pre-market sunrise and post-market sunset point the right way.** The
  statusline's session badges had their chevrons inverted, so pre-market read as
  sunset and post-market as sunrise.
- **A maximized pane's legend stays clear of the status line.** Maximizing an
  indicator pane moved its legend to the top of the chart, where it merged with
  the symbol status line. The legend now stacks below the status line, the same
  way the price pane's legend always has.

## [v0.6.8]

### Added

- **Icon-only contributed actions.** `iconOnly: true` on a topbar action drops the
  desktop button text: the right cluster gets the built-in tools' exact 32px look
  (a `'screenshot'` slot override becomes pixel-faithful), the left cluster keeps
  the primary chrome minus the text. `label` stays required — it becomes the
  aria-label and a kit tooltip, and mobile surfaces keep their text. Without an
  `icon` the flag is ignored with a console warning.
- **Style sync for multi-chart workspaces.** A new **Style** switch in the layout
  dropdown's sync section (and a `style` kind for `ws.sync.set`, with the same
  all-cells or named-group forms as the other links) keeps chart presentation
  identical across linked charts: edits in the settings dialog's Canvas, Scales and
  lines, and Status line tabs apply to every linked chart, turning the link on
  aligns them to the active chart once, and charts a layout change adds while the
  link is on inherit the group's presentation on arrival. Candle colors, line
  width, and other series settings stay individual to each chart.

### Fixed

- **Pre- and post-market shading is instant and follows the complete chart history.**
  The bands now expand locally from the symbol's declared session vocabulary
  (`session`, optional `session_extended`, `timezone` on its metadata) instead of
  round-tripping the provider calendar, so they paint the moment symbol metadata is
  known and panning through arbitrarily deep extended-hours history never waits or
  stops after a fixed lookback. The tint is clipped to loaded candle slots, so it
  never appears before available history or in empty space ahead of the current bar.
- **A long-held plugin context now follows the market.** `ctx.symbol`, `ctx.timeframe`
  and `ctx.priceStyle` (plus a workspace's `ctx.cells` and `ctx.activeCellId`) were
  snapshots taken when the context was built: an attachment keeping its mount context
  kept reading the mount-time market after a symbol switch — a screenshot could
  capture the current chart but name the file after the old one. They are live now,
  like `ctx.chart` always was.

## [v0.6.7]

### Added

- **Provider-owned symbol icons.** A new optional `resolveSymbolIcon(descriptor)`
  on the `DataProvider` port hands each provider the icon URL for its own symbols —
  the shells (symbol search rows, status-line avatar, object-tree price row) route
  every badge to the descriptor's OWNING provider and render a colored-initials
  fallback when there is no resolver, no URL, or the image fails. The bundled
  crypto providers (Binance, Coinbase, Hyperliquid) predefine the Ledger
  crypto-icon CDN — the shell itself no longer assumes any asset class, so a
  provider serving equities stops producing doomed crypto-CDN lookups. Behavior
  note: a third-party provider without a resolver now gets initials instead of a
  guessed crypto icon — one line restores it (`resolveSymbolIcon`).
- **Custom symbol ordering.** `registerSymbolRanking(hook)` (plugin SDK) hands a
  plugin or host the display order of the symbol-search dialog: the hook receives
  the whole aggregated pool (every source combined), returns it in display order,
  and may inject or omit entries (first duplicate wins). It runs when the pool
  changes — never per keystroke — and may be async. While registered, the built-in
  "majors first" pin stands down: the head of the returned list is the dialog's
  opening screen; under a typed query the relevance tiers still lead, with the
  custom order breaking ties. `filterSymbols` gained a `top` parameter
  (`string[] | false`) for the empty-query pin policy.
- **Built-in slot overrides.** A plugin can now TAKE OVER a built-in topbar button by
  registering its action under the built-in id (`registerWidgetAction({ id:
'indicators' | 'screenshot', ... })`): the contributed button replaces the native one
  in place, and the slot's whole surface follows — the mobile counterpart and the
  keyboard chord (`/`, `mod+alt+S`) route to the override, and the native machinery
  (the built-in indicator picker dialog) is not constructed. Stateful composite slots
  (symbol, timeframes, style, layout, undo-redo, alerts, panels) are not overridable
  and refuse the registration with a warning. Position follows the composition rules:
  a host-declared list has the last word; on a default side an override sits in the
  native slot unless it declares `order` (then it flows like an ordinary action).

- **Composable topbar.** A new `topbar: { left, right }` shell option lists the
  VISIBLE topbar entries per side, in render order — built-in ids (`'symbol'`,
  `'timeframes'`, `'style'`, `'layout'`, `'indicators'`, `'actions'`, `'undo-redo'`,
  `'alerts'`, `'panels'`, `'screenshot'`) and/or contributed-action ids, which pins
  those actions at exact positions (overriding their `align`/`order`; the `'actions'`
  entry is the flow slot for the unpinned rest). An undeclared side keeps its default,
  so the option is pure opt-in. An explicit list is the side's complete contract:
  unlisted entries don't render, and a hidden entry loses its mobile counterpart and
  keyboard chord too (`mod+alt+S` goes with `'screenshot'`; Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y stay).
  The replace-a-built-in recipe becomes declarative — hide `'screenshot'`, pin your
  own dropdown action in its place.

### Deprecated

- **`indicatorPicker` is deprecated** (both shells) — removal in 0.7.0. To hide the
  built-in indicator surface, omit `'indicators'` from `topbar.left` (same effect: no
  button, no mobile stop, no `/`, no dialog); to replace it, register an action under
  the id `'indicators'` (see _Built-in slot overrides_) — no shell option needed.

## [v0.6.6]

### Added

- **Reset an indicator's settings to its defaults.** The indicator settings dialog
  gained a "Reset defaults" button on the left of its footer: one click restores
  every input to the value the indicator declares, re-running it immediately — the
  same affordance the chart settings dialog already offers. A reset is still
  cancelable: Cancel keeps reverting the whole session to the values the dialog
  opened with.
- **Shell-routed indicator adds for plugins.** The contribution context gained
  `ctx.addIndicator({ name, script, language? })` and `ctx.addNativeIndicator(type)`:
  unlike the raw `chart.addIndicator` / `chart.addNativeIndicator`, additions made
  through them enter the shell's unified undo/redo timeline and the topbar indicator
  count — a custom indicator menu now behaves exactly like the built-in picker under
  Ctrl+Z. These externally-added scripts stay OUT of the persisted manifest ledger
  (their names can't resolve against the host manifest); persisting them is the
  plugin's job, via the seam below.
- **Third-party state in the persisted document.** `registerStatePersistence({ key,
scope: 'cell' | 'global', serialize, restore })` lets a plugin store its own state
  inside the shell's state document instead of a parallel store: entries live in new
  `ext` bags (`state.ext` at the document root, `charts[i].ext` per chart) under
  namespaced keys. `serialize` runs on every snapshot; `restore` runs when a document
  carrying the key is applied — after the core state, and muted for cell scope so a
  restore never pollutes undo/redo. The codec passes `ext` through opaquely: entries
  whose plugin isn't loaded still round-trip, so no data is lost on a plugin-less
  reload. `ctx.stateChanged()` schedules a save for state changes the shell can't see.
- **Single-chart workspaces.** `layout: false` pins a `VelaWorkspace` to one chart:
  the layout picker and the sync switches disappear (desktop and mobile),
  `setLayout` becomes a no-op, and no `cells` entry is needed — the top-level chart
  options seed the single chart. A previously persisted multi-chart document still
  restores its first chart; the others stay dormant.
- **Restores that keep the chart alive.** `applyState` now applies a document IN
  PLACE when it matches the live grid (same layout, same slots): markets switch on
  the existing charts, so chart references, indicator handles, and event
  subscriptions survive a restore — including the late restore of an async storage
  backend. Structural changes still rebuild as before.
- **Workspace toasts.** `ws.toast(message, kind?, durationMs?)` shows a notice on
  the same surface the workspace's own alerts and script errors use.
- **Readable alert provenance.** Alert toasts and the bell menu now name their
  source as `SYMBOL timeframe Indicator` instead of the internal cell id, and a new
  `alertCap` option sets how many alerts the bell keeps (default 50). The chart's
  `alert` event now carries the firing indicator's display title.
- **`drawings` honored by the workspace.** `drawings: false` removes the whole
  drawing surface (the shared toolbar, the mobile entry, the tool pill — the
  programmatic `chart.drawings` API stays); `{ tools }` / `{ groups }` pick what the
  shared toolbar offers, exactly as they do on a lone chart.
- **Hide chart-settings entries you don't want to expose.** A new `settings` option
  (chart, widget, and workspace) takes a list of setting ids to hide from the chart
  settings dialog — a whole tab (`'advanced'`), a group (`'canvas.grid'`), or a single
  row (`'canvas.grid.vertical'`); a tab with nothing left disappears from the rail.
  Hiding is display-only: the hidden values keep applying, so an embedder can force a
  value through its options and remove the control that would let users change it.
  Everything stays visible by default. Call `chart.renderer.listSettingsIds()` to
  enumerate the addressable ids of a live chart — plugin chart types and host-app
  sections are included automatically, with no changes needed on their side — or set
  the policy at runtime with `chart.renderer.setSettingsVisibility(...)`.
- **Panes with a categorical (or blank) value axis.** A native indicator whose visuals
  are painted entirely by a plugin renderer layer can now declare that its pane's
  content is not value-mapped: the pane then shows no price numbers, no horizontal
  gridlines, and no crosshair value chip — and instead of a blank axis it can label its
  own bands (one label per row, placed at any height), the right reading for table- or
  ribbon-style panes where a price scale would be meaningless. The labels follow the
  indicator's settings live, and merging a regular series into the pane brings the
  price axis back automatically.

### Changed

- **`VelaWidget` is deprecated.** The single-chart app is now `VelaWorkspace` with
  `layout: false` — same chart, same options, same persisted state document. The old
  class remains for this release as a thin wrapper (a console notice says so) and will
  be removed in a future release; replace `new VelaWidget(el, opts)` with
  `new VelaWorkspace(el, { ...opts, layout: false })`, and pass `persist: 'vela-widget'`
  to keep reading the state the widget stored. _(Breaking: the widget-only `urlState`
  option no longer does anything — encode `getState()` into your own URL scheme for
  shareable links — and state saved by very old versions in the pre-unified three-key
  layout is no longer migrated.)_

### Fixed

- **A workspace now says so when no provider serves a symbol** — the same one-time
  notice a single-chart shell shows, instead of a silently blank cell.
- **Destroying one shell no longer evicts another's cached history.** The shared
  bar cache scopes its protected symbols per shell instance; releasing one leaves
  the others' intact.
- **The range chips stay truthful.** Changing the timeframe through the API or a
  contributed action now clears the highlighted range chip, and framing a range
  through the API highlights it — the bar follows the chart, whichever path drove
  the change.

## [v0.6.5]

### Fixed

- **Layer-drawn indicators obey the object tree.** Indicators that paint through a
  plugin renderer layer (order-flow overlays and the like) now take part in the
  chart's stacking and pane structure like any other indicator: dragging one in the
  object tree — or using Bring to front / Send to back — actually moves it in front
  of or behind the candles, moving it to another pane takes its painting along (the
  new pane scales itself to the visible bars, and collapsing it blanks the painting),
  and a fresh add is recorded at the top of the stack, which is where such overlays
  really paint — so the tree reads true from the start. Screenshots composite in the
  same order the chart shows. The gridlines stay at the very back throughout: sending
  an indicator behind the candles never hides it behind the grid.

- **The symbol picker browses past its first page.** The search dialog's list was
  hard-capped at 100 rows with no way to load more — on a 13k-symbol venue (US
  equities) the Stocks tab stopped mid-alphabet and everything beyond needed an
  explicit search. Scrolling near the bottom now loads the next 100 rows in place,
  repeatedly, until the pool is exhausted; the rows already on screen never
  reshuffle, and a new query or tab starts back at one page.

## [v0.6.4]

### Added

- **Indicator inputs that show only when they matter.** An indicator input can now
  declare a condition on another input's current value (a toggle being on, a dropdown
  sitting on one choice or any of several), and its row appears in the settings dialog
  only while that condition holds. The dialog re-evaluates live on every edit — flip
  the governing toggle and the dependent rows appear or disappear in place, group
  headings and tabs whose inputs are all hidden leave with them, and a hidden input
  keeps its value for when it comes back.

- **Auto and Log toggles on the price scale.** Hovering a price scale now reveals
  two small buttons at its bottom — **A** for autoscale and **L** for the
  logarithmic scale — sitting on a full-width background strip so the axis values
  behind them stay readable. Each click toggles its mode for the hovered pane
  independently (log never snaps the scale back to auto), and an active mode wears
  the filled (selected) button style, so the scale's state is readable at a glance
  without opening the axis menu. Hovering a letter shows its themed tooltip
  (Auto / Logarithmic scale).
- **Pre- and post-market session shading.** On markets with trading sessions,
  showing the extended tape now tints the pre-market and post-market time bands
  behind the candles (faint orange and blue by default), derived from the
  provider's market calendar. Both colors are editable — chart settings → Symbol →
  Trading session — and persist with the rest of the chart settings. The same
  Trading session group also carries a Session dropdown, so RTH/ETH can be
  switched from the settings dialog as well as from the bottom bar. The group
  only appears on markets that actually have sessions.

### Changed

- **Right-click menus mark the active choice with a checkmark.** Context menus
  anchored at the pointer — the price-axis, time-axis and chart-body menus, and
  the indicator legend's row menu — now show the selected entry with a ✓ on its
  left instead of a highlighted row, so selection never reads as hover. Dropdown
  menus opened from a button (timeframe, chart style, time zone) keep the
  highlighted-row style.
- **The legend's status indicator steps aside while a row is open.** While an
  indicator's legend row shows its action buttons (on hover or selection), the
  loading dots / live pulse move to after the buttons instead of sitting between
  the title and the actions, so the buttons stay glued to the title.
- **The RTH/ETH toggle only appears on markets with sessions.** The bottom bar's
  session switch used to sit disabled on continuous markets (crypto); it is now
  hidden entirely there and appears once the active symbol declares real trading
  sessions.
- **UI text is no longer selectable.** Chrome text everywhere — titles, buttons,
  menus, legends, dialog labels — can't be text-selected anymore (a drag or a
  sloppy double-click used to leave blue selections across the UI). Text-entry
  fields (text, number, textarea) keep normal selection, and the data window's
  readout stays selectable too — it is data meant to be copied out.

### Fixed

- **Input titles are fully inert.** In the settings and indicator dialogs, an
  input's title no longer reacts to hover or clicks (native `label[for]`
  forwarding used to light up and activate the control from its title) — only
  the input itself is interactive. Titles keep naming their control for
  assistive tech via `aria-labelledby`.

- **The workspace toolbar follows chart-style changes.** In a multi-chart
  workspace, changing the active chart's style now updates the toolbar's style
  button and its menu checkmark immediately — previously they refreshed only
  when the active chart changed, so the button kept showing the old style's
  icon.
- **The timeframe button no longer looks stuck pressed.** Without favorite
  timeframes, the compact timeframe trigger drew a permanent highlight
  background. It now highlights on hover only, like the buttons around it; the
  in-place highlight still marks the current timeframe among favorite chips.

## [v0.6.2]

### Added

- **Settings field layer on the UI kit.** Labeled rows, section headings, and a
  control factory (`fieldRow` / `fieldSection` / `buildFieldControl`) live in
  `@luxalgo/vela/ui`, so chart settings, indicator inputs, and drawing settings
  share one row language. Kit `Dialog` gained top/center alignment, a footer
  slot, and a contained (chart-hosted) mode; those three surfaces use it. New
  `TextArea` and `GlyphSelect` (`widthField`) primitives replace the last
  hand-rolled textarea and line-width pickers.
- **Drawing settings dialog.** The gear on a position tool, fixed-range volume
  profile, or Fibonacci/Mach levels opens a real settings dialog (same shell as
  indicator inputs) instead of an inline panel. Cancel restores the open-time
  snapshot; Ok keeps the live edits. The compact drawing toolbar is unchanged.
- **Market calendars (`DataProvider.getCalendar`).** A provider may now serve the
  RESOLVED market calendar — ascending epoch-ms `[start, end)` open windows with
  holidays and DST already applied by the source, `session` selecting the regular
  or extended set. It is the single market-time truth for session-anchored
  consumers; nothing in Vela recomputes a holiday. Continuous venues simply omit
  the method.
- **A real market-status badge.** The statusline's session badge (widget and
  workspace cells) now derives its state from the provider calendar — Market
  Open / Pre-Market / Post-Market / Market Closed / Market Holiday — and
  re-derives itself at every session boundary. Symbols without a calendar keep
  the permanent "Market Open" exactly as before.
- **The chart session reaches data engines.** `SeriesDataEngineHost.session` and
  `NativeIndicatorContext.session` expose the chart's trading session
  (`'regular'` | `'extended'`) to chart-type data engines and native indicators,
  so session-anchored fetchers can request the tape the chart is actually
  showing. A session switch rebuilds engines/indicators, so the value is stable
  within one host's lifetime.

### Fixed

- **RTH↔ETH no longer resets the viewport.** A session-only `setMarket` flip
  carries the current zoom/position over the reload (the time axis is the same
  clock — only which bars exist changes); an explicit `visibleRange` from the
  caller still wins, and symbol/timeframe switches keep the usual re-frame.

## [v0.6.1]

### Added

- **Trading sessions (RTH/ETH).** Charts gain a `session` dimension
  (`'regular'` | `'extended'`) on markets that have one: pass it as a chart option,
  switch it with `chart.setMarket({ session })`, or click the bottombar's RTH/ETH
  toggle — previously a disabled stub, now live and enabled automatically when the
  active symbol's metadata declares real sessions (crypto keeps the disabled chips).
  A session switch reloads like a timeframe change; the two sessions cache as
  separate series (their bars genuinely differ), the flag rides every provider
  request (`BarRange.session`, `subscribe` `opts.session`), persists per cell
  (`extended` only — documents stay lean), and travels in shareable URLs
  (`?session=extended`). In a workspace the toggle acts on the ACTIVE cell, like
  the range chips.

## [v0.6.0]

### Added

- **Per-symbol listing prefixes (TradingView parity).** A provider's symbol
  descriptors may declare `prefix: 'NASDAQ'` — the venue the instrument is _listed_
  on, a property of the symbol rather than of the provider. When declared,
  `NASDAQ:AAPL` resolves through it (strictly: `NYSE:AAPL` matches nothing, no
  auto-correction), every label displays it — legend venue chip, symbol-search
  badges — and the picker commits and the workspace persists the canonical
  `NASDAQ:AAPL` form. Typing the listing venue in the symbol search scopes it
  (`nasdaq AAP`), like provider names always have. Explicit provider-name prefixes
  keep routing (persisted `edgx:AAPL` documents re-display canonically), and
  symbols without a declared prefix behave exactly as before. New `chart.data`
  members: `displayPrefix(symbol)` and `canonicalSymbol(symbol)`.

## [v0.5.4]

### Added

- **Form controls on the UI kit.** Toggles, dropdowns, number and text fields, the
  color picker, and a shared popover shell are available from `@luxalgo/vela/ui`,
  so a host can build settings panels that match the chart's own chrome. The
  indicator dialog, chart settings, and drawing toolbar now share those controls
  instead of each drawing its own.
- **Tabs in the indicator settings dialog.** An indicator input can name the tab it
  lives on, and the settings dialog grows one tab per name next to the default
  "Inputs" tab — click a tab to switch between its controls. Inputs that name no tab
  stay on "Inputs", so existing indicators look exactly as before.
- **Favorite timeframes.** Hover a row in the topbar's timeframe dropdown and a star
  appears — click it to pin that timeframe (starred rows keep their gold star). Pinned
  timeframes sit as duration-sorted chips with the current value highlighted in place;
  an unstarred current sits next to the caret, which opens the full list (or the
  combined label+caret when nothing is starred). The set persists with the rest of the
  chart state, and a workspace shares one set across all charts.

### Changed

- **Settings fields share one closed size.** Number, text, and dropdown triggers
  are a 100px column; a long string ellipsizes instead of stretching the control.
  The open dropdown list still sizes to the longest item. The position tool's
  Stop/Target rows use that same column (no narrower field next to the unit
  dropdown), and indicator-dialog tabs use 13px type.
- **Chart settings dropdowns use the themed list.** Selecting a value in Chart
  settings opens the same overlay list the indicator dialog already used, instead
  of the operating system's native popup.
- **Chart settings uses the same kit chrome as indicator settings.** Number fields
  are 34px with a focus ring and hover steppers, color inputs are the inset chip,
  and toggles / dropdowns / line-width pickers match that 14px field instead of
  the older 28px compact chrome. Values still commit live as you type.
- **Drawing gear panels use the same kit chrome as settings.** Position, fixed-range
  volume profile, and Fibonacci/Mach level editors (plus the highlighter's free-width
  field) are the shared number, select, switch, text, and color controls instead of
  native inputs and checkboxes. Those editors now open as a settings dialog from
  the gear; the compact icon toolbar (glyph dropdowns, color underline) is unchanged.
- **Indicator settings sit closer together.** The dialog follows the same rhythm as
  the rest of the settings chrome: a 20px title with more air above the tab strip,
  16px between a label and its control, 34×100px fields, 16px between rows, and a
  16px footer around 34px Cancel/Ok. A color input shows a square chip with the
  same field border as the other controls and opens the shared swatch picker.
  Dropdowns and the date calendar use the dialog surface plus an outer shadow,
  the same 14px type, and a thin overlay scrollbar. Number fields grow small
  right-side steppers on hover, session times are typeable comboboxes, and group
  headers keep more space above and below the title.
- **Trend-line labels follow the line.** A label on a trend line, ray, extended
  line, info line, or trend angle sits along the segment instead of staying
  horizontal, and flips so the text never reads upside-down.
- **User drawings no longer expand the price scale.** Placing or dragging a drawing
  into the empty margin leaves the pane fitted to the series — the window does not
  jump to follow the cursor. Pine drawings still fold into autoscale as before.
- **Open menus stay put if their trigger moves.** Starring a timeframe (which adds a
  chip and shifts the caret) no longer drags the open dropdown with it — the list
  keeps the position it had when it opened.

### Fixed

- **Legend load dots sit beside the title, not glued to it.** While an indicator is
  fetching, the three pulsing dots now keep an 8px gap to the right of the title
  (they used to sit flush against the last letter) and drop 1px so they optically
  match the title's midline.

## [v0.5.3]

### Changed

- **Wheel zoom steps further per notch.** Scrolling the chart in or out now
  covers more of the time axis per turn of the wheel, so reaching a target zoom
  takes fewer notches.
- **`modulateBase` is consulted on every mounted renderer layer.** The hook is no
  longer limited to the layer whose id matches the active price style — any layer
  that implements it (a chart type or an overlay) can slim or fade the base
  candles for the current frame. When several layers speak, each field keeps the
  strongest (smallest) request; `null` remains no opinion. Overlay indicators that
  need a gap beside the candles use the same seam the chart types already did.

## [v0.5.2]

### Changed

- **Indicator legend action hit targets.** Hovering an indicator title reveals
  equal-sized hide, settings, move-to and remove buttons with a larger clickable area
  and a background wash on each — without growing the chip's height, so rows below
  stay put. Plot values beside the title do not open the chip.
- **Selection in menus reads from the row itself.** The timeframe, chart type, and
  every other selectable dropdown now mark the active entry with a stronger row
  background instead of a leading checkmark, and the mobile three-dots sheet does the
  same — the selected item is visible at a glance without scanning for a glyph.
- **The symbol watermark yields to loading.** While a chart's bars are loading, the
  faded symbol watermark stays hidden so it never overlaps the loading indicator; it
  returns as soon as the first bars paint.
- **The symbol watermark sits on the price pane only.** The faded "SYMBOL · TF" mark
  used to center on the whole plot, so a study pane (RSI, MACD, …) carried the same
  ghost text as the candles. It now clips to the price pane's bounds — including
  when that pane is resized, collapsed, or a study is maximized (the mark hides
  rather than landing on the study).
- **Favorite stars are gold everywhere.** The mobile drawings sheet's favorite star
  now lights up in the same gold as the desktop drawing toolbar's, instead of blue.
- **The highlighter's width is typed, not picked.** The drawing quick bar shows a
  numeric width field for the highlighter (honoring its 4–60px range) instead of the
  1–4px list, which couldn't even express its 14px default.
- **Crosshair sync mirrors the price level too.** With crosshair sync on in a
  multi-chart workspace, charts showing the SAME ticker as the hovered one now draw
  the ghost's horizontal price line alongside the vertical time line, with the price
  labeled on their own scale (hover the price pane — a study pane's value is not a
  price). Charts on other markets keep the time-only ghost: a foreign price level
  would be noise on their scale. For custom consumers, the crosshair event now names
  the pane kind under the cursor (`paneKind`), so a host can make the same call.
- **Mobile chrome polish.** The timeframe sheet labels its date-range chips and
  timeframe grid with matching white section headers (no divider between them), and
  highlights the active chip in white. In the drawings sheet the search field and
  group tabs stay pinned while the tool list scrolls. The in-chart status line drops
  the O/H/L/C block on mobile and stacks the bar change under an aligned
  logo / symbol / timeframe / market-status row. The scroll-to-latest control is
  smaller and only appears when the latest bars are off-screen. Time zone moved out
  of the three-dots sheet onto a long-press of the time axis; a long-press on the
  price scale opens a price-scale sheet. The LuxAlgo attribution mark keeps its
  desktop size and is only slightly smaller on mobile; the faded symbol watermark
  caps at a quieter size.

### Added

- **Right-click cancels an in-progress drawing.** While placing a drawing, a
  right-click discards the unfinished shape and returns to the pointer — even in
  stay-in-drawing-mode — without opening the chart's context menu. A right-click with
  nothing being placed keeps opening the context menu as before.
- **Replaceable indicator menu.** A new `indicatorPicker` shell option (widget and
  workspace, default `true`) removes the built-in indicator dialog's entry points —
  the topbar button, the mobile-bar item, and the `/` shortcut — so a host can ship
  its own indicator UI (for example a contributed topbar action opening a custom
  dialog) without two competing menus. The `indicators` manifest still resolves and
  auto-adds its enabled entries. Contributed topbar actions can take the vacated
  spot for real: `align: 'left'` on a widget action places its button with the
  primary chrome buttons right after the style dropdown, in the built-in Indicators
  button's own position and styling, instead of the right-hand tools cluster — and
  on the mobile chrome it gets its own icon stop in the bottom bar (the built-in
  indicators slot) rather than a row in the three-dots sheet.
- **A mobile chrome for the widget.** In a narrow container — or on a touch-first
  device, or forced with the new `layoutMode` shell option (`'auto' | 'mobile' |
'desktop'`) — the widget swaps its desktop bars for one touch-sized bottom bar:
  symbol search, timeframe, indicators, drawings, a three-dots drawer, and chart
  settings. The timeframe entry opens a bottom sheet with the date-range presets and
  the timeframe grid; the drawings entry opens a searchable, tabbed tool sheet with
  favorite stars — swipe sideways across the tool list to move between the group
  tabs — and an armed tool shows a floating pill over the chart with the
  magnet, stay-in-drawing-mode and eraser controls; the three-dots sheet carries
  undo/redo, screenshot, chart type, the side panels (which open full-screen on
  mobile), alerts, and any contributed actions. A long-press on the time axis opens
  the time-zone sheet; a long-press on the price scale opens scale settings. Symbol
  search, the indicator picker, chart settings and indicator settings all present
  full-screen; in chart settings the section list sits behind a burger button, a
  section's groups become scrollable tabs, and multi-instance strips (like a
  footprint's) scroll sideways. The chart itself gains the touch gestures the chrome
  assumes: one-finger pan with inertia, two-finger pinch zoom, a long-press that
  inspects with the crosshair without moving the view, and a double-tap that mirrors
  the desktop double-click — on the price or time axis it resets that scale's view,
  and inside the plot it maximizes/restores the tapped pane. The button that jumps
  back to the most recent bar appears when those bars are off-screen. Desktop
  behavior is unchanged, and the mode follows the container live — resizing across
  the breakpoint swaps the chrome in place.
- **The workspace shares the mobile chrome.** `VelaWorkspace` honors the same
  `layoutMode` option and auto-detection: on mobile the shared topbar, desktop
  bottombar and the docked drawing-toolbar column give way to the same touch-first
  bottom bar, sheets and full-screen pickers, all acting on the active cell. The
  three-dots sheet additionally carries the multi-chart **Layout** picker — the same
  tap-to-apply grid canvas as the desktop topbar's layout dropdown, its non-grid
  preset rows, and the symbol/interval/crosshair sync switches. The grid-wide
  attribution mark also picks up the smaller mobile lockup the widget uses.
  Multi-cell grids keep each cell's status line on ONE row — segments that don't fit
  the cell hide instead of wrapping (bar change first, then the venue/timeframe, then
  the market badge; the logo + ticker always stay). On mobile the indicator legend is
  **collapsed by default** behind its count chip, and in a multi-cell grid the chip
  routes to the **object tree** instead of unfolding in place — whose indicator action
  menu gains an **"Indicator settings"** entry (the legend gear's twin).
- **Plugin SDK: two per-indicator chrome seams on the renderer port.**
  `IChartRenderer.setLegendOverviewAction?(action)` lets a host shell replace the
  indicator legend's fold toggle with its own overview entry point (the workspace
  routes it to the object tree on mobile grids), and
  `IChartRenderer.openIndicatorSettings?(indicatorId)` opens one indicator's settings
  dialog programmatically — the legend gear's twin, surfaced on `chart.renderer` as
  `setLegendOverviewAction` / `openIndicatorSettings` (+ `supportsIndicatorSettings`).
  Both are additive and optional: a renderer without them keeps today's behavior.
- **`vela/ui` gains a `Drawer`.** A bottom sheet with a grab handle and a dimmed
  backdrop — the primitive the mobile chrome's sheets are built on, exported for
  building your own. Pulling down dismisses from anywhere on the sheet, not just the
  handle (a scrolled list keeps native scrolling until it is back at the top), an
  `onSwipe` option turns decidedly horizontal swipes into a callback (the drawings
  sheet pages its tabs with it), and opening never pops the on-screen keyboard — the
  sheet itself takes the initial focus, never a search field.

### Fixed

- **Pane separators stay visible while a market switch loads.** Changing the timeframe
  or the symbol clears the chart while the new bars load; the dividers between stacked
  panes used to vanish for that whole window (and slightly beyond it), leaving the
  price pane and the study panes reading as one undivided plot. The separators now
  stay in place through the load.
- **Legend fold count stays readable on a light plot.** The indicator-count chip on a
  folded legend now paints its number (and chevron) with the plot's own text color, so a
  white chart no longer shows a near-white digit on a white chip.
- **Long freehand strokes keep their shape.** Drawing with the brush or highlighter
  for a long stretch no longer degrades into a single straight line chasing the
  cursor: when a stroke reaches its point budget, the older trail thins gracefully
  and the capture keeps going, so the whole gesture lands on the chart.
- **Multi-chart borders stay under chart settings.** Hovering a cell seam in a
  multi-chart workspace no longer draws the splitter highlight through an open chart
  settings dialog — the dialog now stacks above the grid chrome.
- **Screenshots capture the whole chart.** The PNG export now includes everything the
  screen shows: the volume columns, the visible-range volume profile, plugin-drawn
  layers, the status line, the indicator legends (with their values), and the faded
  symbol watermark — previously only the candles, axes and drawings made it into the
  image. Only the crosshair stays out.

## [v0.5.1]

### Added

- **Drawings sync across a workspace grid.** A new `drawings` sync kind
  (`ws.sync.set('drawings', true)`, also a toggle on the shared drawing toolbar) links
  drawings across same-group cells: a newly created drawing is copied onto the others
  (anchors are time+price, so it lands at the same spot whatever each cell shows), and
  the set stays linked — moving, restyling or deleting any member follows on its peers.
  Placement mirrors **live**: while anchors are still being clicked, linked charts show
  the in-progress shape as a reduced-opacity ghost. Link membership is session-scoped
  and survives a toggle-off (re-enabling resumes edit/delete for drawings paired
  earlier; drawings created while off stay independent), and a reload leaves every
  drawing unpaired again. The on/off setting persists like the other sync kinds.
- **Plugin SDK: a draft seam on the drawings port.** `DrawingIntent` gains an optional
  `draft` arm (placement progress, `null` at the end) surfaced as the `drawing:draft`
  chart event, and `IDrawingsRendererPort` gains an optional `setExternalGhost(doc)` —
  the drawings twin of `setExternalCrosshair`. Both are additive: a renderer that
  implements neither keeps today's behavior (sync at completion, no remote preview).

## [v0.5.0]

### Added

- **Indicator legends show their plot values.** Each indicator's legend row now
  displays the current value of every plot to the right of its title, colored like
  the plot itself. The values follow the crosshair — hover a bar and they read that
  bar; move off the chart and they rest on the latest bar, ticking with live data.
  Hovering the legend row itself sets the values aside while its controls (eye, gear,
  ✕…) are out, so the row never crowds. Right-clicking a legend row opens a small
  menu whose "Indicator values" entry shows or hides that indicator's values, and
  chart settings → Status line → Indicators gains a "Values" toggle that shows or
  hides them for every indicator at once. The chart-wide choice persists with the
  rest of the chart state.

- **Duplicate-keyed settings rows stay in sync.** Several `when`-gated chart-type
  settings rows may now store under the same bag key(s) — the pattern for per-mode
  rows over one shared state (each mode gets its own row label while the stored
  toggle and colors stay one value). The settings dialog re-syncs every keyed
  control (checkbox, color swatch, select) from the values bag on each edit, so a
  hidden twin row never shows stale state when its gate brings it back.

- **Inline line-width dropdown and number input on settings toggle rows.** A chart
  type's settings toggle row may now carry `width: { key, label, defval }` next to
  its `colors` swatches — a compact dropdown offering the drawing bar's classic
  1–5 px weights, each option previewed as a line at that weight — and
  `number: { key, label, defval, min?, max?, step? }`, a compact number input ahead
  of the swatches. Both dim with the swatches while the toggle is off and store
  plain numbers in the type's bag — the declarative replacement for separate
  `number` rows gated on the toggle. A swatch may carry its own `when` gate (same
  shape as a row's), letting one toggle row swap its swatch set live as another value
  changes — a mode's two colors while it is on, its one alternative while off; a
  self-gated swatch stays interactive through the toggle-off dim. And a structured
  section with a single always-present instance no longer renders its one-tab strip —
  sections that go structured purely for the group TOC keep a clean pane top.

- **Chart settings open on the active style's tab.** When the active price style is a
  chart type with its own settings tab (visibility `'active'`), opening the settings
  dialog now lands on that tab instead of Symbol — the pane a user opening settings
  under that style is usually after. An explicit `showSection` still wins.

- **Candle settings for plugin chart types that draw candles.** A registered chart type
  that keeps the candle series under its own layer (an order-flow style, for example) now
  gets a Candles group in chart settings → Symbol while it is active: body, border, and
  wick toggles with their up/down colors, plus the bar spacing. These cosmetics belong to
  that chart type alone — changing them restyles its candles without touching the Candles
  or Heikin Ashi styles, and any value left untouched keeps following the shared candle
  settings. They persist and export with the rest of the chart config.

- **Plugin layers can fade the chart under them and follow the pointer.** A renderer
  layer registered through the plugin SDK gains three quieter levers. It can now dim or
  slim the base painting gradually — its `modulateBase` hook returns per-frame candle
  body width/opacity and grid opacity, the smooth counterpart of the all-or-nothing
  `basePainting: 'none'` — so a style that reveals under the candles as you zoom in can
  fade them down instead of switching them off. A layer that reacts to hovering
  (tooltips, row highlights) can declare `repaintOnCursor` and is repainted whenever the
  pointer moves, receiving the pointer position with its paint arguments. And a chart
  type's settings tab can now include `heading` rows — group titles that organize a
  large tab into named sections.

- **Settings tabs that show only what matters — and scale past one flat list.**
  Chart-type settings stay pure data but gain structure. A row may carry a `when`
  condition (`{ key, equals }` / `{ key, anyOf }`, or an AND-ed array) and is shown only
  while the gate passes against the tab's current values — the dialog re-evaluates live
  on every edit, so mode-specific colors or a manual-size input appear exactly when they
  apply. A section may declare `instances` instead of flat rows: the pane opens with a
  tab strip — one tab per present instance, a dashed `+` that turns the next one on, an
  `×` on the active removable tab — with presence stored as a plain boolean
  (`enableKey`) in the same per-type bag. Inside an instance (and inside the new
  `subsections`, indented entries under the section's rail tab), `heading` rows become a
  group TOC on the left of the pane that shows one group at a time. And
  `placement: 'after-symbol'` puts a type's tab directly under Symbol. Two row forms
  keep panes static where a conditional reveal would jump the layout: a toggle row may
  carry inline color swatches (`colors` — edited on the toggle's own row, dimmed while
  it is off), and a `range` row edits a min–max pair on one line (with an optional
  `placeholder` naming the unset state, so a cleared input reads "Off" instead of a
  magic 0). Select options may be `[value, label]` pairs so camelCase ids show as
  human text. A subsection's `enableKey` soft-disables its other rows (visible but
  grayed) while off, instead of hiding them. Hidden rows keep their stored values;
  persistence and delivery are unchanged — consumers still receive one flat settings
  object.

- **A light theme that actually works — switchable live.** `theme: 'light'` now skins the
  whole product coherently: white surfaces with dark, readable text across the toolbar,
  menus, dialogs, legends, axes, and pane separators. The theme can be swapped at runtime —
  `chart.setTheme('light')`, `widget.setTheme(...)`, or `workspace.setTheme(...)` (which
  re-skins the shared chrome and every cell together) — and users reach the same switch in
  chart settings → Canvas → Theme. A `theme:changed` event carries the resolved theme so
  the page around the chart can follow. Candle colors are shared between the built-in
  themes, so switching never recolors the series. Setting just a white background on the
  dark theme (settings → Canvas → Background) now re-bases the derived inks — text, grid,
  axis border — so legends and axis labels stay readable, while an explicitly chosen text
  color always wins. New text annotations (notes, callouts, price tags) pick a
  maximum-contrast text color for the active theme at creation and keep it; existing
  drawings are never recolored.

- **Capturing what a script computes, in one subscription: `script:run`.** Reading a running
  script used to mean assembling it yourself — an event told you _that_ something happened
  and handed you an id, so you looked the indicator up, awaited a snapshot, and then decoded
  it: variable names arrived scope-mangled by the transpiler, values arrived as per-bar
  buffers you had to index, nothing said whether the script was a strategy, and the title on
  the handle was a placeholder the declared name never replaced. The chart now reports the
  run itself. One subscription gives the declared title, whether it is an indicator or a
  strategy, each plot's value at the computed bar, the script's own variables under the names
  written in the source, and — for a strategy — its broker state: position, average entry
  price, equity, open and net P&L, win/loss counts, drawdown and run-up. Nothing to resolve,
  nothing to await. `chart.runScript(source)` is the same thing for code you execute
  yourself: it resolves the first run, follows later ones through `onUpdate`, and removes the
  script with `remove()` — injecting it only if it ran, exactly like `runIndicator`. A
  workspace relays every cell's runs as one event tagged with the cell, so a grid needs a
  single listener even as layouts create and destroy cells.
- **Runs say what caused them, so a recorder can tell provisional from final.** A live
  script re-computes constantly, and until now every re-computation looked alike — which
  made "write this to a database" or "raise this alert" quietly unsafe, because the value
  could still move. Each run now carries its cause: the first pass over the history, a tick
  refining the bar that is still open, a **new bar** (which makes the one before it final),
  an input edit, a viewport move, or a market switch. Ticks are throttled to about one a
  second, since a stream re-runs the open candle far faster than any dashboard can use;
  every other cause is reported unconditionally, so the moment a bar closes is never
  dropped. Two flags complete the picture: whether the run's last bar is still open, and
  whether it saw the full history (false only while a progressive engine is still being fed
  a deep backfill).
- **The parts that can grow without bound stay off the event.** A strategy's trade ledger and
  a plot's full history are a call away — `await run.trades()`, `await run.series('fast')` —
  so a listener firing every second never carries thousands of rows it will not read. And a
  chart with no listener does no work at all: the execution-context read that fills a run
  happens only when someone is subscribed.
- **The drawing toolbar collapses out of the way.** A chevron at the bottom of the docked
  toolbar folds it into a slim strip, giving the chart the full width; the strip keeps just
  that chevron, and one click brings the whole toolbar back. The plot re-flows to the new
  width in both directions.
- **The bottom-bar clock opens the time-zone menu.** The time and the zone label are now one
  button: clicking the clock itself brings up the same zone picker as clicking the zone name
  next to it.
- **The indicator legend folds away.** With two or more indicators on the chart, a
  bordered chevron sits under the price-pane legend rows; clicking it folds every
  pane's indicator titles — study panes included — into a compact "˅ N" chip (and
  back), so a busy legend stops covering the plots. The toggle disappears when a
  single indicator is left.
- **Hosts can follow in-chart settings edits.** `chart.renderer.onConfigChanged(cb)` fires
  whenever the cosmetic config changes — the settings dialog commits through it — so host
  chrome that mirrors a config value (a time-zone display, a saved template) can re-read it
  instead of drifting. And a host that owns its own undo shortcuts can turn off the new
  `historyChords` render feature, so the drawings layer lets Ctrl+Z/Y bubble up instead of
  consuming them itself.
- **Hold Shift to draw lines at exact angles.** While placing a trend line, ray, extended
  line, info line, trend angle, or arrow — or dragging one of its endpoints later — holding
  Shift rounds the line to the nearest 45° step as drawn on screen: horizontal, vertical, or
  a perfect diagonal. The magnet is set aside while Shift is held, so the locked angle is
  kept exactly rather than being pulled off-axis by a nearby candle.

### Changed

- **Visible Range Volume Profile is named in full.** The built-in volume profile of
  the visible range now appears in the indicator picker as "Visible Range Volume
  Profile", with the short legend label "VRVP" (it was previously titled "VPVR"
  everywhere). Native indicators may also declare an optional `shortTitle` so the
  legend stays compact while the picker and settings dialog keep the full name.
- **An indicator that is fetching shows quiet load dots in its legend.** While an
  indicator's data is in flight, its legend row now ends with three small pulsing
  dots — the same load affordance the chart itself shows while bars load — at the
  row's right end. The old circular spinner to the left of the title is gone.
- **Scripting engines report a strategy's state in neutral terms.** An engine that simulates
  order execution now describes it with the same vocabulary whatever language it runs, so one
  dashboard reads them all. Engines are also expected to report a script's variables under
  the names written in the source: a transpiler's internal scoping scheme is its own business
  and no longer reaches the page. _(Breaking for engine authors: the execution-context
  snapshot gained `strategy` and `trades`, and its `variables` must no longer be
  bucket-prefixed or mangled. Engines that report neither still work — a run then carries the
  title, cause and plots the model already supplies.)_
- **The script return value is gone from the execution-context snapshot.** It was documented
  as the way a script hands structured data to host code, and it never worked: the bundled
  Pine runtime rejects a `return` of an object or a tuple outright, and the field came back
  as one null per bar. Anything a script wants to expose goes through its variables, its
  plots, or — for a strategy — its broker state, all of which now arrive named and usable.
  _(Breaking: `EngineContextSnapshot.result` and the `'result'` selector were removed. Nothing
  could have been reading a meaningful value from them.)_
- **One time-zone catalog, everywhere.** The bottom bar and the chart-settings dialog now
  offer the same list of zones — every UTC offset from UTC-12 to UTC+14, half- and
  quarter-hour offsets included, each shown with its live (DST-aware) offset and a city
  label. Picking a zone in the settings dialog updates the bottom bar and vice versa — in a
  workspace it updates every cell, since the display zone is workspace-global; the dialog
  used to carry its own short list of raw zone identifiers, and a choice made there never
  reached the rest of the interface.
- **Drawing-toolbar tooltips appear when you'd expect them.** Hovering a toolbar icon now
  shows its tooltip after a short pause instead of a two-second wait, and a tool group's
  tooltip names the exact tool its icon will arm (the group's last-used one), not just the
  group.

### Fixed

- **Chart-type data engines now receive stored settings on (re)creation.** A type's
  data engine used to hear about its settings only through live dialog edits — a
  persisted config restore or a market switch (which recreates engines) left the
  fresh engine fetching on schema defaults until the user touched the dialog. The
  orchestrator now remembers the last-seen per-type values and replays them into
  every newly created engine just before `start()` (a pre-start `onSettings` is
  pure configuration by contract).
- **The fixed-range volume profile emphasizes its value area.** The default fills were
  inverted — the value area rendered more transparent than the tails around it. The value
  area is now the opaque region and the outside rows recede. Its POC line also stops
  defaulting to the accent blue: until you pick a color for it, the POC draws in the
  active theme's contrast ink — white on a dark chart, black on a light one — and follows
  a theme switch immediately. A POC color you picked yourself, and profiles already
  saved, are left untouched.
- **Tooltips in the indicator settings dialog no longer hide behind it.** The ⓘ input
  hints and the dialog's own control tips opened underneath the dialog card, where they
  were unreadable; they now stack above it like every other tooltip.
- **Opening the Indicators dialog closes an open indicator-settings dialog.** The two
  dialogs used to stack — the topbar picker never counted as a click outside the
  in-chart dialog. It now dismisses it on open, the same way the symbol search already
  did, in the widget and in every workspace cell.
- **Undo steps back exactly one action when drawings and indicators mix.** With a drawing
  and an indicator change both in the history, one Ctrl+Z over the chart used to revert
  both at once — the drawing layer and the app history each answered the shortcut. A single
  press now undoes a single action, whatever its kind. The same holds in a workspace, where
  a cell's drawing edits now enter that cell's own undo timeline alongside its indicator
  changes instead of living in a parallel history.
- **Removing an indicator from the legend can be undone.** Removals made outside the
  indicator picker — the legend ✕, the object tree, `handle.remove()` — never entered the
  undo history, so Ctrl+Z skipped straight past them. They now land in the same timeline as
  every other edit, and undo brings the indicator back — in the widget and in every
  workspace cell alike.
- **The indicator legend follows the chart background.** Changing the background color in
  chart settings repaints the legend rows with it; they used to keep the color they were
  created with and float as stale chips over the new background.
- **The price and time scales follow the chart background.** Changing the background color
  in chart settings now repaints the axis scales with it, so the plot and its scales read
  as one surface; they used to stay on the app theme's color and frame a recolored chart
  with the old one.
- **The status line's readout follows the chart style.** Bar-shaped styles (candles,
  bars, Heikin Ashi) read out all four O/H/L/C values; a one-line style (line, area,
  baseline) plots a single series, so its readout is just that value — plus the change,
  always. And the whole readout shares one ink that follows the ACTIVE style instead of
  fixed theme tokens (the OHLC and the change even used two DIFFERENT palettes): the
  configured candle-body colors, bar-tick colors, the plot color for line/area — and
  for baseline, the top/bottom line colors picked by the bar's POSITION against the
  live baseline price, the way the paint itself splits (a bar that closed down can sit
  in the green region; its values are green there). Everything re-tints when a settings
  edit recolors the style or the style switches, in the widget and in every workspace
  cell. Hosts building similar chrome can read the new read-only `baselinePrice` render
  feature — the resolved reference price the baseline paint splits on.
- **The attribution mark stays on real plot area.** It anchors to the bottom-left of the
  lowest visible, non-collapsed pane — the same rule the scroll-to-realtime button already
  followed — so collapsing the bottom study pane (or maximizing another) lifts the mark
  into the lowest open pane instead of leaving it on a collapsed strip's legend.
- **The chrome shows the bare ticker, never `venue:TICKER`.** The topbar symbol button, the
  in-chart status line, the watermark and the object tree used to echo the raw symbol
  string, so a venue-pinned pick (the symbol picker composes `binance:BTCUSDT`) leaked the
  routing prefix into every label. They now display the ticker alone — the venue already
  shows where it belongs: the status line's meta segment and the picker's venue badges.
- **The status line lines up with the indicator legend.** Its left offset was hardcoded to
  clear the widget's docked drawing toolbar, so in a workspace cell (no per-cell toolbar) it
  floated 44px right of the legend, and a collapsed toolbar left it hanging mid-air. The
  renderer now publishes its toolbar gutter as `--vela-toolbar-gutter` on the mount
  container and the status line anchors to it, keeping the two in one column in every
  shell and toolbar state.
- **Workspace dividers stay between charts.** In a mixed layout — say three charts stacked
  on the left beside two taller ones on the right — the divider between two stacked charts
  used to run the full width of the grid, so hovering or dragging over a neighboring chart
  could grab the divider instead of the chart under the pointer. A divider now covers only
  the stretch where two charts actually meet. Its hover highlight also matches the pane
  dividers inside a chart — the same soft band with a solid center line, in the theme's
  text color — instead of the old blue accent strip.
- **The symbol watermark stays inside its own chart.** The faded "SYMBOL · TF" mark was
  sized against the browser window, so in a multi-chart workspace a small cell could get
  type far wider than itself, spilling the text across its neighbors. The mark now measures
  itself against its own chart and shrinks to fit — a lone full-size chart keeps the large
  type, a dense grid gets proportionally smaller marks, and dragging a divider refits them
  live. The mark also fits and centers on the plot itself rather than the full chart, so in
  a narrow cell the text no longer runs under the price scale's numbers.
- **Resizing no longer makes charts flash or shake.** Two resize bugs, most visible in a
  workspace: dragging a divider across a chart mid-animation (a live tick easing in, a zoom
  glide) could blank it for a frame on every move, because the resized canvases waited for
  the next animation frame to repaint — they now repaint immediately. And a resize or layout
  change could leave a chart trembling rapidly (and burning a full animation loop in the
  background) until it was clicked: the zoom limits move with the chart's width, and an
  in-flight zoom or scroll animation whose destination fell outside the new limits kept
  chasing it forever. The animation now settles on the nearest reachable point and stops.

## [v0.4.6]

### Changed

- **History loads in one request up to 5 000 bars, in 10 000-bar chunks beyond.** The load
  used to start with a 200-bar head and widen by doubling (200 → 400 → 800 → …), which at
  the shells' default depth meant FOUR serialized round trips before the full history was
  there. That shape bought a faster first candle — but nothing downstream can use it: an
  indicator's first run is held until the whole depth lands (Pine is causal, so running it
  per chunk would repaint a different curve at every step). A round trip costs far more
  than the extra rows, so the ordinary case is now a single request, and the progressive
  path is reserved for genuinely deep history, where its chunks are flat 10 000-bar steps
  rather than a ramp. A rangeless feed keeps its preview-then-full shape past the same
  threshold, and a requested initial window still loads in one framed pass.

### Fixed

- **The chart-settings dialog closes when you click its ✕.** The header's drag handler
  skipped itself for the close button by comparing `e.target` to the button — but the
  button holds an SVG icon, so a press anywhere on the ✕ targets the icon's `<path>`
  instead. The header therefore took pointer capture and swallowed the click: the button
  only ever worked on the few pixels of padding around the glyph. It now tests ancestry
  (`closest`), like the other two draggable dialog headers already did.
- **Changing the bar count no longer rebuilds the chart.** `setMarket({ bars })` on the
  same market went through the full reload pipeline: it handed the renderer a fresh
  200-bar head, then doubled its way back up (200 → 400 → 800 → …), so the array was
  wholly replaced ~6 times and momentarily held FEWER bars than before the change. Every
  replacement was a "fresh series", which re-frames the view — the user's zoom was thrown
  away on any depth change, in both directions. A depth-only change is now an EXTENSION:
  growing re-enters the same backfill loop the initial load uses (older bars prepend, the
  viewport is preserved), shrinking trims the array in place from the oldest end, and
  neither restarts the indicator sessions. A feed with no ranged fetch, or an offline
  `data` series, still reloads — there is nothing to extend from.
- **An indicator no longer paints shifted while the bar array changes under it.** Anchor
  offsets were stored only when positive, so a model whose `anchorTime` was OLDER than the
  chart's first bar — exactly what a shorter series produces — was pinned at index 0 and
  drawn with its first value on the chart's first bar, i.e. the whole plot shifted left,
  for as long as the load took. Offsets are signed now: such a model skips the values that
  fall off the left edge instead. The renderer's logical interaction anchors (zoom glide,
  hover) learned the same symmetry — they followed a prepend but not a front trim.
- **A value patch can clear an indicator's anchor.** `anchorTime` was omitted rather than
  stated when a run spanned the whole chart, and an omitted key cannot undo a previous
  anchor — the model kept the offset of an earlier, narrower run. Patches now always carry
  the anchor, `null` included.
- **A workspace with named cells reported an empty grid.** `ws.cells()` came back empty
  for any workspace that declared its cells (`cells: { btc: …, eth: … }`): it looked the
  layout's positional slots up among the cells' own names, which only match when no name
  was declared. Everything else already spoke names — `ws.cell('btc')`, the active cell,
  the saved document — so the grid was consistent everywhere except this one list, and
  what read it inherited the blank. A plugin asking its widget context which charts the
  grid holds got nothing; a plugin registered _after_ the workspace was built never got
  its legend buttons onto the cells already on screen; and opening the symbol search left
  the other cells' in-chart dialogs open. Cells are now listed the way the rest of the
  workspace identifies them, in slot order, still leaving out the ones a smaller layout
  has parked.
- **Documentation that did not match the code.** The README advertised a screenshot
  shortcut that never existed (`alt+S`; the binding has always been `mod+alt+S`), left
  `vela/workspace` out of the entry-point list, described `persist` as restoring four
  cosmetic keys when it restores the whole state document — drawings and indicators
  included, listed two of the three `indicators` manifest forms (the async loader was
  missing), and still passed the removed `provider` option in both quick-start snippets.
  In the SDK, `WidgetContext.chart` claimed the shell rebuilds its chart on every
  symbol/timeframe change; those switches are applied in place.

### Added

- **Renderer feature defaults for plugins: `registerRendererDefaults`.** A renderer
  feature is per-chart state, set on an instance that does not exist yet when a plugin's
  enabler runs — so a plugin could contribute a chart type, an engine or a panel, but not
  "every chart should start with this feature set". This registry is the missing half,
  shaped like the other contribution registries and the renderer-side counterpart of
  `registerDefaultEngine`, except it reaches EVERY chart: the widget's, each workspace
  cell's, and a bare `new Vela()`. Values apply once the renderer mounts, before the first
  paint; they are defaults, not locks (an explicit `renderer.set(...)` or a restored
  config still wins), and charts already built are untouched. The disposer removes
  precisely what it set.

## [v0.4.5]

### Added

- **Strategy trades paint on the chart: `IndicatorModel.trades`.** An engine (or a native
  indicator) can now emit the ORDER EXECUTIONS of a strategy — `TradeExecution { time,
price, side, kind, label?, qty?, tradeId? }` — and the native renderer paints each one
  as a marker unit on the price pane: a fixed-size direction arrow hugging the fill bar
  (buys point up from below the low, sells down from above the high; exit fills carry a
  cap between arrow and bar), the order id and the signed quantity stacked OUTWARD from
  the bar (the quantity is always the outermost line), and a small tick at the exact fill
  price on the bar's trade-side edge. Fills on the same bar stack outward in execution
  order. The price pane's autoscale reserves the stacks' pixel headroom, so markers under
  the lows never clip at the pane edge. Executions ride the normal model/patch path:
  hiding the indicator hides its markers, removing it removes them, and `chart.inspect()`
  counts them (`trades` per indicator + in the totals).
- **The `tradeMarkers` renderer feature.** `chart.renderer.set('tradeMarkers', { visible?,
labels?, qty?, colors? })` — hide the units, the order-id line, or the quantity line, and
  override the palette (`colors: { long, short, exit }`, defaults `#2962ff` / `#f23645` /
  `#d500f9`; the text stays the theme's neutral text color). Partial merge, malformed
  fields dropped; persisted in the rich config (`trades` section) so templates carry it.
- **A `trades` renderer capability** (optional, like `drawingDepth`). The native renderer
  declares it; a custom renderer without it simply never paints the channel.

## [v0.4.0]

### Removed

- **BREAKING — the Pine Script engine has left this package.** `PineEngine`,
  `PineWorkerEngine` and `PineWorkerOptions` are gone from the root export, and with them
  the `pinets` peer/dev dependency and the build-time worker-inlining plumbing. Pine now
  lives in the **`@luxalgo/vela-pinets`** addon, which implements the same public
  `ScriptingEngine` port with identical semantics:

    ```diff
    - import { Vela, PineWorkerEngine } from '@luxalgo/vela';
    + import { Vela } from '@luxalgo/vela';
    + import { PineWorkerEngine } from '@luxalgo/vela-pinets'; // npm i @luxalgo/vela-pinets pinets
    ```

    Registration is unchanged (`chart.registerEngine('pine', …)`, the shells' `engines`
    option, `registerDefaultEngine`), so a one-line import swap is the whole migration.
    Script-tag users load `vela-pinets.global.js` **after** `vela.global.js`.

    The reason is licensing: the Pine runtime is AGPL-3.0, and shipping it here meant an
    Apache-2.0 library whose most-used feature dragged copyleft obligations behind it. The
    ACL now bans the import outright, so the obligation is taken on only by an application
    that installs the addon. Side effects: `vela.global.js` drops from ~3.5 MB to ~1.0 MB
    (~515 KB minified), and the engine layer becomes the one layer with no bundled default
    at all. See [Scripting engines](docs/user/scripting-engines.md).

### Added

- **Legend rows accept contributed actions: `registerLegendAction`.** An icon button on
  every indicator's legend row (revealed with the built-in controls, before the ✕),
  gated per indicator (`when(ind)`) and run with the shell's context — the seam a host
  editor uses to put "open this script" on each row. Ships with its two supporting
  pieces: **`handle.source`** (the script an indicator was added with — `undefined` for
  natives, the natural `when` gate) and an optional renderer seam
  (`setLegendActions?` on the port, wired by both shells through
  `chart.renderer.setLegendActions`; a custom renderer without it simply never shows
  the buttons). Late registrations appear after `refreshActions()`.
- **Contributed side panels can dock controls in their header.** `mount` now receives a
  third argument — `{ slot, setTitle }`: the slot is the space between the title and the
  close button (icon buttons, a document name), and `setTitle` rewrites the title text
  (empty hides it, the slot owning the row; the topbar toggle keeps the DECLARED title as
  its tooltip). Backward compatible — a two-argument `mount` ignores it.
- **`ctx.togglePanel(id, open?)`** on the plugin `WidgetContext` (both shells): open or
  close a docked side panel programmatically — the seam a plugin uses to open ITS OWN
  contributed panel (a code editor revealing itself on a host action, a panel opened from
  a topbar button). Same semantics as the topbar toggles: the dock stays exclusive, a bare
  call flips, unknown ids are ignored.
- **The symbol string is the whole market identity.** A bare ticker resolves against the
  registered providers in DECLARATION order (first whose index lists it); an `EXCHANGE:`
  prefix — case-insensitive, regional variants included (`BINANCE.US:BTCUSDT`) — pins the
  venue. One grammar everywhere the string travels: the options, `setMarket`, the symbol
  picker (it now composes the prefix from the row you picked — the workspace picker used
  to drop the venue entirely), `urlState` links (they finally carry the venue), and the
  persisted documents (older saves that stored `provider` beside a bare symbol weld back
  together transparently on restore).
- **Workspace cells are NAMED, not numbered.** A `cells` key is a free-form durable
  identity (`btc`, `main`, …) — persistence, `sync` groups and `ws.cell(name)` speak it —
  and DECLARATION ORDER fills the layout's slots. Any entry is optional (an undeclared
  slot boots on the top-level defaults with an auto name); entries beyond the layout wait
  dormant and appear when a larger layout reveals them; purely-numeric names are rejected
  with a warning (JS object keys would silently reorder them).
- **The `indicators` manifest can be an async loader.** `indicators: async () => manifest`
  — for filesystem reads, authenticated APIs, bundler dynamic imports — alongside the
  existing inline and URL forms; a rejecting loader behaves like a failing manifest URL.

- **One options vocabulary for both shells.** `VelaWidgetOptions` and
  `VelaWorkspaceOptions` now share the same base: every chart option (`VelaOptions`) plus
  the shell surface (`VelaShellOptions` — providers, engines, indicators, timeframes,
  timezone, chrome toggles, persistence), the widget adding only `urlState`, the
  workspace adding the grid (`layout`, `cells`, `sync`, `drawingToolbar`,
  `maxWebglCells`) and dropping only `height`. A chart option means the same thing
  everywhere: on the widget it configures the chart, on the workspace it is every
  cell's DEFAULT and `cells` overrides it per cell with the same words — which hands
  the workspace options it never had (`upColor`/`downColor`, `glow`, `animations`,
  `logScale`, `currentPriceLine`, `drawings` — toolbar excepted, the shared bar keeps
  that job — `defaultLanguage`, `renderer`, plus `data` and `visibleRange` top-level
  and per cell). An explicit `nativeBackend` now wins over the `maxWebglCells` budget
  policy. The storage contract is one type for both shells, `VelaStorage`
  (`WidgetStorage` / `WorkspaceStorage` stay as deprecated aliases).

- **An app can make an engine its default with one call.** `registerDefaultEngine(language,
factory)` on `vela/plugin`: every widget and workspace cell built afterwards registers
  `factory()` on its chart automatically (one instance per chart — engines hold per-chart
  state). A per-instance `engines` option still wins for its language, and the bare `Vela`
  chart never reads the registry — with nothing registered, nothing changes anywhere, and
  Vela still bundles no engine.

- **A scripting engine can now be built as a separate package.** `vela/plugin` gained the
  engine-authoring surface: the `ScriptingEngine` port types (completed with
  `EngineContextSnapshot`, `ContextSelect` and `BarsChangeReason`, now also on the root
  entry), the model vocabulary engine output is built from, the `stableSeriesId` identity
  contract — series ids, renderer reconciliation and persisted per-series settings stay
  identical whichever package an engine ships in — and the semantic palette. All additive;
  nothing moves or changes shape. The engine guide (`docs/contributing/adding-an-engine.md`)
  now documents the whole contract to match: the identity rule, the `historyState` /
  `notifyBars(reason)` backfill run policy, the `symbolInfo` / `chartStyle` request
  subtleties, the widget's `engines` factories and their `defaultLanguage` caveat, and
  how to package an engine standalone.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: the `provider` option is gone** — from the chart, the widget, the workspace
  and `setMarket`. Put the venue in the symbol: `provider: 'coinbase', symbol: 'BTC-USD'`
  becomes `symbol: 'coinbase:BTC-USD'`. `chart.market.provider` now reports the symbol's
  own prefix (undefined when bare); the venue that actually served it is
  `chart.data.resolve(symbol)`.
- **BREAKING (workspace): `cells` keys no longer address layout slots.** `cells: { c3: … }`
  used to target the THIRD slot; keys are names now and declaration order assigns slots —
  configs that declared entries in slot order (as every example did) render identically.
- **BREAKING (workspace): `defaults` is gone.** Its keys move to the top level, same
  words: `defaults: { symbol: 'BTCUSDT', timeframe: '60' }` becomes
  `symbol: 'BTCUSDT', timeframe: '60'`.
- **BREAKING (workspace): `persist` now defaults to localStorage**, like the widget —
  `persist: true` survives reloads out of the box. Session-only persistence is the
  opt-in now: pass `storage: memoryStorageAdapter()`.

### Fixed

- **The legend's tooltips are themed, not native.** The row controls (eye, gear,
  move-to-pane, ✕, contributed actions), the settings dialog's ✕ and its ⓘ input hints
  used the browser's `title` bubble — foreign next to the kit tooltips everywhere else.
  They now share one chrome tooltip (`renderers/shared/chrome-tooltip.ts`): same tokens,
  radius and shadow as the kit, self-themed so it works on a BARE chart (no `.vela-ui`
  host), with `aria-label`s kept for accessibility. The drawing toolbar's hand-rolled
  dwell tooltip was folded into the same helper (keeping its deliberate 2 s delay and
  beside-the-tool placement).
- **Typing inside an embedded editor no longer triggers chart shortcuts.** Both shells
  route any bare printable key to the symbol search (letters) or the timeframe entry
  (digits), and the guard that exempts text entry recognised only form controls and
  `contenteditable`. An element that merely declares `role="textbox"` — which is how
  editors built on the **EditContext API** (Monaco among them) expose their input — fell
  through it, so every letter typed into a docked code editor opened the symbol search
  instead. The guard now accepts that third spelling, and the widget, the workspace and
  the keymap share ONE definition of it (`isEditableTarget`) rather than the three
  near-copies they had drifted into.

## [v0.3.0]

### Added

- **Side panels are an extension point.** The column the object tree and the data window live in
  is now a dock any plugin can join: `registerSidePanel({ id, title, icon, mount })` adds a panel
  with the same header, the same close button, and its own toggle button in the topbar beside the
  other two. The plugin fills the panel's body and never touches the rest of the interface; the
  dock keeps exactly one panel open at a time, so the chart never loses more width than one
  column. A panel can declare itself **resizable** — a handle on its inner edge, dragged within
  the bounds it sets, double-click back to its declared width — and which panel is open plus the
  widths you dragged now come back with the rest of your saved chart.

- **The chart says when it is loading.** Three small dots pulse quietly at the center of the
  plot while a market's first bars are on their way — when the chart first opens, and again
  after every symbol or timeframe change. They disappear the moment the first candles paint
  (on deep histories, the quick recent-window preview), and they never show over data. While
  they are up the chart is genuinely blank: everything drawn from the bars goes with the
  series, and script-drawn dashboards (tables), which are pinned to pane corners rather than
  to bars, hide for the load and return with the data. A chart whose symbol no venue can
  serve drops the dots rather than promising bars that aren't coming.
- **Candles appear after one small request.** The first paint no longer waits for the whole
  requested history: the newest 200 bars load first — one quick request, candles on screen —
  and the rest streams in behind the interactive chart in steps that double up to the 10k
  chunk size, with the viewport held in place as older bars extend the left edge. Doubling
  keeps the request count logarithmic, so a slow venue costs a handful of round-trips instead
  of one per fixed step. Every load works this way — the first open, and every symbol or
  timeframe switch — so the loading dots give way to candles as fast as the venue can answer
  one small request. `history:progress` now reports each step as it lands, and `ready()` (and
  `setMarket`) resolve at that first paint — `historyComplete()` still awaits the full depth.
- **Loads announce themselves to plugins.** Two new chart events bracket every bar load:
  `load:start` fires before the first fetch — before the chart is blanked — carrying the new
  market and a first-load flag, and exactly one `load:end` follows once the first candles
  paint (or with `bars: 0` when a load fails, comes back empty, or parks). Extensions, plugins
  and custom indicators use the pair to hide their own visuals during the gap and rebuild them
  when the data is back; a depth-only reload fires neither.

### Changed

- **Switching markets clears the chart first.** Changing the symbol or timeframe now blanks the
  old candles immediately and shows the loading dots until the new market's first bars arrive —
  the previous market no longer lingers under the new symbol's name while its data loads.
  A plugin chart type's data engine is silenced and its layer data blanked in the same breath:
  its per-bar payloads are keyed by bucket time, so on a same-timeframe switch the old market's
  cells would land exactly on the new market's first candles. Changing only the history depth
  keeps the chart painted, as before.
- **The topbar's panel buttons are built from the dock.** They used to be two fixed buttons wired
  to two fixed callbacks. _(Breaking, for hosts that construct `Topbar` themselves: the
  `onObjectsClick` and `onDataWindowClick` options are gone, and `setPanelActive` now takes any
  panel id — the dock supplies the buttons through `setPanelButtons`. Nothing changes for users
  of `VelaWidget` or `VelaWorkspace`.)_

### Fixed

- **Removed and added indicators are remembered reliably.** Two persistence flaws could
  misremember the indicator set across a reload. A chart restored from a saved state kept its
  boot-time indicator list as a fallback, and on charts built without an `indicators` manifest
  (or before it resolved) that fallback shadowed a deliberately emptied set — removing the last
  indicator, Volume included, brought it back on the next load, every time. And the saved
  document read indicator presence from a copy that refreshed asynchronously, so an add or
  remove followed quickly by a reload could be missed entirely. Snapshots now read presence
  from the chart synchronously (`chart.presentNativeIndicators()`, a new public read) and the
  restored-state fallback ends the moment the live set becomes the truth — an empty chart you
  emptied stays empty, and a change made a heartbeat before leaving the page survives it.

- **Symbol search understands exchanges again.** Typing an exchange's name surfaces its symbols
  (after any ticker matches), and an exchange prefix scopes the search to that venue — `binance:btc`
  and `binance btc` both list Binance's BTC… pairs, a unique shorthand like `coin btc` works too,
  and the exchange name alone (or with `:`) browses the whole venue A to Z. This search shipped in
  the picker's original design but was lost in a port.

## [v0.2.0]

### Added

- **Undo and redo in the top bar.** Next to Indicators, a hairline and two icon buttons step
  through the same undo/redo history as the keyboard shortcuts — drawings and indicator changes
  alike. Each button dims when there is nothing to undo or redo.
- **Stay in drawing mode.** A toolbar toggle under the magnet (pen with a lock) keeps the
  armed tool ready after each placement, so you can draw several of the same shape without
  re-picking the tool. Turn it off for the usual one-shot behavior; the brush family still
  stays armed either way.
- **Position sizing on the long/short tool.** The long/short position drawing now sizes from
  your account: open its gear settings to set a risk percentage and account balance, and the
  chart shows the dollar loss at the stop and the matching position size alongside the usual
  risk:reward and percentage labels. The position size is itself editable — type the size you
  want and the risk percentage adjusts to match. Drag from the entry in the profit direction —
  higher for a long, lower for a short — and the profit zone follows that way; the stop lands on
  the opposite side. A direction switch in the panel turns the whole trade around in place,
  mirroring the stop and target across the entry with the risk:reward preserved. The stop and
  target take exact values in your choice of unit — the absolute price or points from the entry —
  and switching the unit re-expresses the current value without moving the level. Every label has
  its own toggle: the direction-and-ratio header, the loss-and-size line, the target and stop
  labels, the level prices inside them, or all text at once; the profit and loss zones recolor
  from the quick-settings bar, and the label color and size are adjustable too.
- **Multi-chart workspaces.** The new `VelaWorkspace` puts several full charts on one screen:
  pick a grid from the layout menu in the top bar — single, two side by side, two stacked,
  four, or eight — and resize the cells by dragging the dividers between them (double-click a
  divider for an even split). Every cell is a complete chart with its own symbol, timeframe,
  chart type, indicators, and drawings; several cells can even show the same symbol. Plugins
  can register extra grid presets, and they appear in the layout menu automatically.
- **One interface for every chart.** A workspace shows a single top bar, symbol search,
  indicator picker, drawing toolbar, object tree, and bottom bar — all reflecting and acting
  on the **active** chart, outlined in blue. Click any cell to make it active and the whole
  interface follows; keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo, and the timeframe keys route to it too.
  Alerts from every chart collect in one list, each tagged with the chart it came from, and
  selecting one jumps to that chart. Dialogs such as chart settings open centered over the
  whole workspace, and each chart's settings include its own status-line, watermark, and
  data-depth sections. One discreet logo mark for the whole grid instead of one per chart.
- **Charts switch markets in place.** Changing a chart's symbol, timeframe, or history depth —
  in a workspace or in the single-chart widget — no longer rebuilds it. Indicators re-compute
  over the new bars, and your drawings, settings, and event subscriptions simply carry over.
  Switching feels instant, with no flash and nothing lost.
- **Linked charts.** Link every chart — or named groups of charts — so they move together:
  **viewport** links keep panning and zooming in step (mixed timeframes stay aligned on the
  latest bars), **symbol** and **timeframe** links retarget the linked charts when one of them
  changes, and **crosshair** linking projects the moment under your pointer onto every linked
  chart as a subtle ghost line with its time tag — snapped to each chart's own bars, so
  hovering 14:00 on an hourly chart lights that same day on a daily one. Crosshair sync is one
  switch in the layout menu.
- **Your workspace comes back as you left it.** Turn on persistence and the entire workspace
  survives a reload: the layout and divider positions, the active chart, the links between
  charts, the timezone, favorite drawing tools, and — per chart — the symbol, timeframe, chart
  type, history depth, watermark, indicators, drawings, and appearance settings. Storage is
  pluggable: keep the built-in browser storage, stay in-memory, or plug your own backend (for
  example a per-user server store) through a two-method adapter.
- **Read and restore everything from code.** One call returns the whole workspace — or the
  whole widget — as a single document; its counterpart restores it, and a change event tells
  you when to save. Server-side snapshots, shareable links, and layout templates are all built
  from these two calls. The widget speaks the exact same format as the workspace (it is simply
  the one-chart case), so a saved widget chart can be dropped into a workspace slot as-is.
- **Shortcuts from the first keystroke.** A new `autofocus` option on the widget and the
  workspace focuses the chart as soon as it mounts, so keyboard shortcuts work the moment
  the chart appears — no initial click needed. It stays off by default, so a chart embedded
  next to other page content never steals the keyboard focus.
- **Quicker mouse control of the view and drawings.** Hold `Shift` and scroll to glide through
  chart history instead of zooming, `Shift`-click an empty spot to start measuring from that
  exact point, and middle-click a drawing to delete it — no toolbar round-trip needed. The
  drawing toolbar's menus now show each tool's keyboard shortcut beside it, with the favorite
  star at the far edge of the row, and the `?` shortcuts panel lists the mouse gestures too.
- **A reorganized object tree.** The panel now mirrors how the chart is actually built: every
  item sits under the pane it belongs to, and in the main chart the price series takes its own
  place in the stack among the overlay indicators, in the order they draw. Drawings are listed
  under their tool's name with that tool's icon, an indicator drawing against its own scale is
  marked as such, and a locked drawing keeps its padlock in view instead of hiding it until you
  hover. Right-click any row for the actions there is no room for on it: show or hide, lock,
  duplicate, bring to front or send to back, remove, and — for an indicator — move it into
  another pane or out into a new one of its own. Each pane's header carries its own controls to
  reorder, collapse, or maximize it. Rows can also be dragged: drop an indicator on another pane
  to move it there, on the band between two panes to open a fresh one, or anywhere in the main
  chart's stack to choose what draws in front — the price series included. Drawings drag the same
  way, restacking within their pane or landing in another one to move there. A label follows the
  pointer and the panel shows where the drop will land before you release.
- **Drawings can be grouped and handled as one.** Click a drawing in the object tree to select
  it, holding Ctrl (or Cmd) to add more — the chart highlights everything you pick — and a bar at
  the top of the panel offers to bundle the selection into a group or duplicate all of it at once.
  A group gets a row of its own that folds shut over its members, and its eye, padlock and remove
  act on every drawing inside it. Rename it to whatever the bundle means to you. A group drags
  anywhere a single drawing can go — another place in the stack, or another pane — carrying its
  members and their order with it, and dropping a loose drawing onto a group adds it to the
  bundle. Right-clicking gives you the rest: adding a drawing to a group or taking it out again,
  hiding or locking a whole group, ungrouping it, or deleting it with everything in it. Groups
  last as long as the chart stays open and are not part of what persistence saves.
- **Drawings can sit anywhere in the chart's stack.** A drawing no longer has to sit on top of
  the price: it can go under the candles, between two indicators, or behind everything, so it
  reads as background — a zone or a band you see the data through instead of across. Each pane in
  the object tree is now one column, top to bottom as front to back — its drawings, its
  indicators and the price series together — and you drag a drawing (or a whole group, which
  moves as one block) to any slot in it; **Bring to front** and **Send to back** on a drawing's
  menu now clear the entire stack, candles and indicators included. A drawing under the data
  stays fully yours to work with — click it, move it, reshape it as before, and its handles still
  draw on top so you can see what you have hold of. The whole stacking order is saved with your
  chart, comes back on reload, and drawing moves can be undone.
- **A data window beside the chart.** The data-window button in the top bar opens a panel docked
  to the right, the object tree's sibling: the date and time of the bar under your pointer, its
  open, high, low, close and volume tinted with the bar's direction, then one section per
  indicator showing each plot's value in the plot's own color. It follows the crosshair as you
  move across the chart and falls back to the latest bar when the pointer leaves, so it always
  shows something useful. The two panels share the dock — opening one closes the other — and in a
  workspace the readout follows the active chart as you switch cells.

### Changed

- **Chrome polish on the widget and workspace.** The top bar sits tighter, timeframe / chart
  style / Indicators read in bright white, the Indicators count badge is gone, the camera sits
  to the right of the object tree, and chart settings move to a gear on the bottom bar next to
  the session switch. The in-chart attribution mark uses the LuxAlgo symbol and expands the
  LuxAlgo wordmark on hover — white on dark charts, dark on light ones.
- **One visual language across the whole chart.** Colors, icons and hover states now come from a
  single set of definitions instead of being restated in each panel, so the interface reads as one
  piece. The settings dialog, drawing toolbar, drawing style popups, color pickers, pane controls
  and the legend follow the chart theme — on a light chart they are now light, where before they
  stayed dark whatever the theme. Indicator titles in the legend all read in the normal chart text
  color, native ones included, instead of a blue of their own. Every subdivided drawing tool paints
  its levels with the same convention, so the 0.618 of a retracement, a fan, an arc set and a Gann
  box match; the same holds for bullish/bearish reds and greens, which were previously two slightly
  different pairs depending on the tool. Icons across the toolbars and menus are one consistent set
  at one weight, and they take the color of the control they sit in; several were redrawn to read
  more clearly at their small size — among them the gear, the trash bin, the baseline and
  Heikin Ashi chart styles, the Fibonacci wedge, the Fibonacci speed-resistance arcs, the
  trend-based Fibonacci extension, and the long/short position tools.
  Indicators share one icon everywhere they appear — the top bar, the pickers and the
  object tree — and every icon button responds to the pointer the same way: resting in a muted
  tone and brightening to white on hover, with the same soft backing. Color swatches everywhere are
  square, inputs and dropdowns in the chart settings share the dialog's own surface, the pointer
  cursor only appears over things that actually respond to a click, and the indicator legend sits
  on a solid chart-colored backing so its labels stay readable over the candles.
- **Reorganized right-click menus.** Each part of the chart now offers what belongs to it. The
  chart body gives you reset the view, remove every drawing, remove every indicator, and the
  settings dialog — the two removals stay in place but grey out when there is nothing to remove.
  The price axis carries the whole scale: autoscale, invert, and the choice between regular,
  percent, indexed to 100 and logarithmic, plus submenus for the axis labels, the last-price
  label, the countdown to bar close and the last-price line. Every pane has its own scale menu,
  so a study pane's scale no longer follows the price one. The time axis picks the display
  timezone, and choosing one there updates the timezone shown on the bottom bar as well. Each
  menu's settings entry opens the chart settings on the tab it is about — the canvas colors and
  grid from the chart body, the scales and lines from either axis — so you land on the controls
  you were reaching for instead of the first tab.
- **The price now reads on top by default.** A new overlay indicator starts _behind_ the candles
  (and behind the indicators already there), and a new drawing starts _just under_ them, so the
  price stays the top of the pile until you restack things yourself — drag rows in the object
  tree, or use Bring to front / Send to back. _(Breaking: overlays and drawings used to paint
  over the candles by default; raise them in the object tree to get the old look back.)_
- **The widget now persists the full chart, not just preferences.** Where persistence used to
  restore the symbol, timeframe, style, and a few settings as defaults, it now brings the whole
  chart back — drawings, indicators, and appearance included. Previously saved preferences are
  migrated automatically the first time the new version runs.
- **Removing an indicator sticks.** Removing the built-in Volume — or any indicator — now
  holds across symbol and timeframe switches and across reloads, whichever way you removed it
  (the indicators dialog, the legend, or the object tree). Before, auto-added indicators could
  quietly return on the next switch or reload.
- **Text is typed straight onto the chart.** Placing a text annotation now drops a blinking caret
  where you clicked, next to an "Enter Text" placeholder, and the words appear on the chart as you
  type them — no settings field in between, and a thin gray frame around the words while you are
  editing them. Text annotations start out large, so they read at a glance without reaching for the
  size control. Enter starts a new line; clicking away (or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter) keeps the text and
  Escape puts back what was there; a text annotation you never typed into is
  dropped instead of left blank on the chart. Double-clicking existing text — or a callout — opens
  the same on-chart editor. Finished text keeps that frame as its selection cue: firm when the
  annotation is selected, fainter under the cursor, so you can see where the words can be grabbed.
  The quick-settings bar opens alongside the caret, as it does for every other tool, and now carries
  the text color and size on the bar itself, with bold and italic under the text field where the
  words are — restyle while you type and the chart follows, without the edit being interrupted.
  Previously a text annotation arrived pre-filled with the word "Text", had to be edited through the
  settings popup, and its formatting was two clicks deep.
- **The data window is a docked panel, not a floating box.** It used to hover over the top-right
  corner of the chart and was switched on with the `dataWindow` option; it is now the side panel
  described above, opened from the top bar, and it never covers the candles. _(Breaking: the
  `dataWindow` option is gone. If you drove it from code, or built your own readout beside it,
  call `chart.renderer.dataWindowReadout()` — it hands back the same values, ready to display.)_

### Fixed

- **Hiding or locking a drawing now sticks.** Both are saved along with the rest of your chart,
  can be undone, and immediately update everywhere that drawing appears. Before, a hidden or
  locked drawing came back visible and unlocked after a reload.
- **One dialog at a time.** Opening the symbol search now closes an open chart settings or
  indicator settings dialog instead of stacking on top of it. The quick timeframe entry dialog
  centers its input properly, and the faint dots that appeared under the separator lines of
  right-click menus are gone.
- **Keyboard zoom and pan no longer wedge the chart.** Zooming or panning with `Ctrl` + arrow
  keys toward the edge of the chart (or past the zoom limits) could leave the view stuck: the
  animation silently kept running forever and overrode every later scroll-wheel or drag
  gesture, so the chart stopped responding to the mouse. The glide now settles cleanly and
  the mouse always stays in control. `Ctrl` + `←`/`→` also now pans exactly like dragging the
  chart — same limits, same feel: holding the key scrolls continuously and, toward the most
  recent bar, comes to rest on the newest candle plus the usual bit of empty space. And with
  the chart focused, a held `Ctrl` + arrow no longer also moves the crosshair bar — the two
  used to fight over the view, which read as a stuttering bounce while panning.

## [v0.1.0]

### Added

- **A modern charting library, built to be extended.** Vela is a small, robust core surrounded
  by three independently replaceable layers: market-data providers, scripting engines, and
  renderers. Swap any one of them — a different data source, a different indicator language, a
  different drawing backend — without touching the rest of your app.
- **A native GPU renderer.** Charts draw on the GPU (WebGL2) with an automatic canvas fallback:
  candlesticks, bars, line, area, baseline, and Heikin Ashi chart types, multiple panes with
  draggable dividers, smooth eased zooming and inertial panning, an optional neon glow,
  configurable candle colors, log and percent scales, a live countdown to bar close, and light
  or dark themes throughout.
- **Pine Script indicators.** Run Pine indicators through the bundled engine — in the page or
  on a background thread so heavy scripts never freeze the interface. Live ticks update
  indicators incrementally, multi-timeframe and multi-symbol requests fetch real data, and
  hosts can inspect a running script's values from code.
- **Market data out of the box.** Built-in providers for Binance, Coinbase, and Hyperliquid —
  no API keys — with live streaming and a polling fallback. Register several providers at once:
  symbols route to the right venue automatically, or explicitly with an `EXCHANGE:SYMBOL`
  prefix. Deep history paints the recent window immediately and backfills the rest in the
  background with progress events; already-loaded bars are cached and reused. Offline data
  works with no provider at all.
- **Interactive drawing tools.** Sixty-six tools across nine groups — lines, channels and
  pitchforks, shapes, annotations, icon stamps, the full Fibonacci and Gann set, patterns with
  validated harmonics, and forecast and measure tools — with a docked toolbar, magnet snapping,
  an eraser, a measure ruler, favorites, undo/redo, copy/paste, and keyboard shortcuts.
  Drawings anchor to time and price, so they stay locked to the bars across pan, zoom,
  timeframe changes, and reload, and they serialize to JSON for persistence.
- **Built-in indicators.** A per-bar Volume indicator on every chart (removable, restylable)
  and a visible-range volume profile (VPVR) drawn against the right edge — both computed
  natively, no scripting engine required.
- **A complete chart app in one line.** The widget wraps the chart in a ready-made interface:
  a top bar with symbol search, timeframe and chart-type menus and an indicator picker, an
  in-chart status line with live OHLC, a bottom bar with date-range presets, a clock and a
  timezone picker, an object tree, context menus, alert toasts, screenshot export, a keyboard-
  first workflow with a built-in shortcuts panel, and preference persistence with optional
  shareable URL state.
- **A plugin SDK.** Extend Vela from outside the library: register new chart types (with their
  own data engines and settings sections), renderer layers, native indicators, top-bar actions,
  widget attachments, and icons. Plugin chart types appear in the pickers and settings dialogs
  like the built-ins.
